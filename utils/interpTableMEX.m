function [yi, der] = interpTableMEX(X, Y, xi, varargin)
%Interpolate a one-dimensional table with MEX acceleration
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   yi = interpTable(X, Y, xi)
%   yi = interpTable(X, Y, xi, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   X       - Nodes at which underlying function y=y(x) is sampled.
%
%   Y       - Values of the underlying function y=y(x) at the nodes, `X`.
%
%   xi      - Evaluation points for new, interpolated, function values.
%
%   method  - (OPTIONAL) Choose the interpolation method used:
%             1 corresponds to a binary search (optimal for a single lookup
%             in ordered data, default, generally fastest if points are
%             given on an uneven grid)
%             2 will use a binning algorithm which can in very particular
%             cases be faster when a large number of lookups is required.
%             3 will assume that X is completely uniform in grid size. Only
%             the first two entries are used. May give wrong results when
%             assumption is violated - no verification is performed.
% RETURNS:
%   yi - Approximate (interpolated/extrapolated) values of the function
%        y=y(x) at the points `xi`.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `interpTable`.
%
% NOTE:
%   This routine has less functionality and validation of inputs than
%   interpTable, but can be significantly faster.
