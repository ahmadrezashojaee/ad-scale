function state = addDerivedQuantities(model, state)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function state = addDerivedQuantities(model, state)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Computes extra mechanical fields (such as strain, stress) from the
%   primary variable of the mechanical state (state.xd)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   model - Mechanical model
%   state - State variable
%
% RETURNS:
%   state - State variable
