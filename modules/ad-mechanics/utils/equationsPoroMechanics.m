function [eqs, names, types] = equationsPoroMechanics(x, model, fluidp)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [eqs, names, types] = equationsPoroMechanics(x, model, fluidp)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Assemble the residual equations for the mechanical system. The
%   function takes fluid input, given by the pore pressure.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   x      - Displacement
%   model  - Model class instance that is used
%   fluidp - Fluid pressure
%
% RETURNS:
%   eqs   - The residual values as ADI variables (that is with the Jacobian)
%           if the inputs were also ADI.
%   names - The name of each equations
%   types - The type of each equations
%
