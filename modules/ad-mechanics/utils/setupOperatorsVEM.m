%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function operators = setupOperatorsVEM(G, C, el_bc, load, alpha_scaling, S)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Assemble the discretization operators for the mechanical system,
%   using VEM.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G             - Grid structure
%   C             - Stiffness tensor
%   el_bc         - Structure describing the boundary conditions (see VEM_linElast)
%   load          - Structure giving the volumetric forces (see VEM_linElast)
%   alpha_scaling - Coefficient of the stabilisation term (default 1, see VEM_linElast)
%   S             - Stabilization matrix to use (used only in very special
%                   cases, experimental feature, see VEM_linElast)
%
% RETURNS:
%   operators - Structure with the VEM discretization operators.
%
