%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [eqs, names, types, state] = equationsBlackOilMech(state0, st0, p, sW, x, rs, rv, st, wellVars, state, model, dt, mechTerm, drivingForces, varargin)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function is very similar to equationsBlackOil. The difference
%   here is that it also takes as input mechanical terms, and the ADI
%   initialization is not done here but by the model in the
%   getEquations member function.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   state0        - State at previous time step
%   st0           - Status flag as defined by "getCellStatusVO" for previous
%                   time step
%   p             - Pressure
%   sW            - Saturation
%   x             - Variable that is to be decomposed into sG, sO, rs, rv, ...
%   rs, rv        - Dissolved gas, vaporized oil
%   st            - Status flag as defined by "getCellStatusVO" for previous
%                   time step
%   wellVars      - Well variables
%   state         - State at given time step
%   model         - Model class instance that is used.
%   dt            - Time step
%   mechTerm      - Mechanical input which will enter the computation of the
%                   effective porosity
%   drivingForces - Structure that gathers the well parameters and boundary conditions.
%
% RETURNS:
%   eqs   - The residual values as ADI variables (that is with the Jacobian)
%           if the inputs were also ADI.
%   names - The name of each equations
%   types - The type of each equations
%   state - Some field related to well control of the state variables may be updated.
