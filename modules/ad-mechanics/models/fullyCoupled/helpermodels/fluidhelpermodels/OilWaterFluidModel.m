classdef OilWaterFluidModel < TwoPhaseOilWaterModel
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   model = OilWaterFluidModel(G, rock, fluid, varargin)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This model is for the fluid part of a fully coupled poroelastic
%   simulation. It is is derived from the fluid model
%   TwoPhaseOilWaterModel and some few functionalities that are needed
%   for the coupled solver are added.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G        - Grid structure
%   rock     - Rock structure
%   fluid    - Fluid structure
%
% RETURNS:
%   class instance
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   run2DCase, runNorneExample
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   MechFluidModel
