function setRenderFixes(varargin)
%Set fixes which may reduce crashes in MATLAB plots.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   setRenderFixes()
%   setRenderFixes(gcf)
%   setRenderFixes(true)
%   setRenderFixes(gcf, false)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This utility sets two figure and axes properties to values which are
%   known to remove some crashes and oddball behavior with MATLAB plots. If
%   you are not experiencing problems, this file should *NOT* be used.
%
%   The problems it attempts to fix are:
%          - Issued with multi monitor setups when figures become
%          unresponsive accompanied by a stack trace with references to jwt
%          errors. The fix is to set default renderer to opengl, which
%          enables plots to appear on any screen without strange behavior.
%          It should be noted that OpenGL plots have several limitations,
%          for instance missing support for logarithmic axes.
%
%          - Hard crash in MATLAB when plotting more complex figures
%          involving transparent patches, such as large reservoir cases.
%          The solution is to set drawmode to fast on the axes, but this
%          can have strange side effects when rotating objects later on.
%
%   Fixes can be applied and removed, either globally or per figure basis.
%   See next section.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   h      - Handle to figure fixes should be applied to. Defaults to 0
%            (root figure, defaults are applied system wide (!!!) ).
%
%   status - Boolean. If true, fixes are applied (Default). If false, fixes
%            are removed.
%
% RETURNS:
%     Nothing. Changes state of one or more figures.
