function data = readStructField(s, name)
%Read a field from a struct.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   data = readStructField(rock, 'rock.perm:3')
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The inverse function of getStructFields. Acts in much the same manner
%   as s.(name), but has some additional logic to handle multi-column
%   datasets.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   s - struct or numerical vector used to produce the name input by
%       getStructFields.
%
%   name - Name of field requested as output. Must be a valid field as
%          defined by getStructFields.
% RETURNS:
%   data - A Nc x 1 vector or Nc x 3 matrix suitable for plotCellData.
%
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `getStructFields`, `datasetSelector`
