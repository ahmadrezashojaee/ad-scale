function altRotate(varargin)
%Alternative function replacing rotate3d for rotation of 3d figures
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%  This function is called for rotation in some mrst gui plots. The
%  function is intended as a drop-in replacement of rotate3d, which is
%  normally called during object rotation (patch plots and so on). The
%  reason for the replacement is that the default rotation is very slow,
%  due to calls to drawnow as well as several calls to check for legacy
%  functionality.
%
%  altRotate is automatically used by functions where the primary interest
%  is visualization of a 3D reservoir model where rotate3d is too slow to
%  be usable at all.
%
%  To replace the rotate button in an existing plot, see "fastRotateButton"
