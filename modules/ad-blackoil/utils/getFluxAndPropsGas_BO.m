function [vG, bG, mobG, rhoG, pG, upcg, dpG, muG] = getFluxAndPropsGas_BO(model, pO, sG, krG, T, gdz, rv, isSat)
%Get flux and properties for the gas phase for a black-oil problem
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [vG, bG, mobG, rhoG, pG, upcg, dpG] = ...
%      getFluxAndPropsOil_BO(model, pO, sG, krG, T, gdz, rv, isSat)
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Utility function for evaluating mobilities, densities and fluxes for
%   the gas phase in the black-oil (BO)-model
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model - ThreePhaseBlackOil or derived subclass instance
%
%   p     - Oil phase pressure. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%
%   sG    - Gas phase saturation. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%
%   krG   - Gas phase relative permeability, possibly evaluated some
%           three-phase relperm function. One value per cell in simulation
%           grid.
%
%   T     - Transmissibility for the internal interfaces.
%
%   gdz   - Let dz be the gradient of the cell depths, on each interface.
%   Then gdz is the dot product of the dz with the gravity vector of the
%   model. See getGravityGradient for more information.
%
%   rv    - Amount of oil vaporized into the gas phase. Use to evaluate the
%           viscosity and density. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%
%   isSat - Boolean indicator if the gas in the cell is saturated with oil.
%   True indicates that the maximum vaporized gas is present inside the gas
%   phase in the cell, and that we need to look at the saturated tables
%   when evaluating rv-dependent properties. One value per cell in
%   simulation grid.
%
% RETURNS:
%   vG    - Gas flux, at reservoir conditions, at each interface.
%
%   bG    - Gas reciprocal formation volume factors. One value per cell in
%           simulation grid.
%
%   rhoG  - Gas density in each cell.
%
%   pG     - Gas phase pressure. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%           Pressure will be different from the oil pressure if capillary
%           pressure is present in the model.
%
%   upcg  - Upwind indicators for the gas phase. One value per interface.
%
%   dpG   - Phase pressure differential for each interface. Was used to
%           evaluate the phase flux.
