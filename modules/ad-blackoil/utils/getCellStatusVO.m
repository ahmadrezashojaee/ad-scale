function st = getCellStatusVO(sO, sW, sG, varargin)
% Get status flags for each cell in a black-oil model
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   st = getCellStatusVO(model, state, sO, sW, sG)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Get the status flags for the number of phases present.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%
%   sO        - Oil saturation. One value per cell in the simulation grid.
%
%   sW        - Water saturation. One value per cell in the simulation grid.
%
%   sG        - Gas saturation. One value per cell in the simulation grid.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%  
%   status - status that can be provided fom the state for which the status
%            flags are to be computed.
%
%   vapoil - true if there can be vaporized oil 
%
%   disgas  - true if there can be dissolved gas 
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   st - Cell array with three columns with one entry per cell. The
%        interpretation of each flag: 
%      Col 1: A cell is flagged as true if oil is present, but gas
%      is not present.
%      Col 2: A cell is flagged as true if gas is present, but oil
%      is not present.
%      Col 3: A cell is flagged as true if both gas and oil are present and
%      true three-phase flow is occuring.
