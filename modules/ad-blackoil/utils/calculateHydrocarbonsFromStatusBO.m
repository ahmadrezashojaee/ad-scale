% Compute solution variables for the gas/oil/rs/rv-variable in black-oil
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [sG, rs, rv, rsSat, rvSat] = ...
% calculateHydrocarbonsFromStatusBO(model, status, sO, x, rs, rv, pressure)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The ThreePhaseBlackOil model has a single unknown that represents
%   either gas, oil, oil in gas (rs) and gas in oil (rv) on a cell-by-cell
%   basis. The purpose of this function is to easily compute the different
%   quantities from the "x"-variable and other properties, with correct
%   derivatives if any of them are AD-variables.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model    - ThreePhaseBlackOilModel-derived class. Determines if
%              vapoil/disgas is being used and contains the fluid model.
%
%   status   - Status flag as defined by "getCellStatusVO"
%
%   sO       - The tentative oil saturation.
%
%   x        - Variable that is to be decomposed into sG, sO, rs, rv, ...
%
%   rs, rv   - Dissolved gas, vaporized oil
%
%   pressure - Reservoir oil pressure
%
%   disgas   - true if dissolved gas should be taken into account
%
%   vapoil   - true if vaporized oil should be taken into account
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   'field'   -  
% RETURNS:
%
