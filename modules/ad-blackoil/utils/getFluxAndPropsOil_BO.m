%Get flux and properties for the oil phase for a black-oil problem
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [vO, bO, mobO, rhoO, p, upco, dpO] = ...
%      getFluxAndPropsOil_BO(model, p, sO, krO, T, gdz, rs, isSat)
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Utility function for evaluating mobilities, densities and fluxes for
%   the oil phase in the black-oil (BO)-model
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model - ThreePhaseBlackOil or derived subclass instance
%
%   p     - Oil phase pressure. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%
%   sO    - Oil phase saturation. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%
%   krO   - Oil phase relative permeability, possibly evaluated some
%           three-phase relperm function. One value per cell in simulation
%           grid.
%
%   T     - Transmissibility for the internal interfaces.
%
%   gdz   - Let dz be the gradient of the cell depths, on each interface.
%   Then gdz is the dot product of the dz with the gravity vector of the
%   model. See getGravityGradient for more information.
%
%   rs    - Amount of gas dissolved into the oil phase. Use to evaluate the
%           viscosity and density. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%
%   isSat - Boolean indicator if the oil in the cell is saturated with gas.
%   True indicates that there is free gas in the cell, and that we need to
%   look at the saturated tables when evaluating rs-dependent properties.
%   One value per cell in simulation grid.
%
% RETURNS:
%   vO    - Oil flux, at reservoir conditions, at each interface.
%
%   bO    - Oil reciprocal formation volume factors. One value per cell in
%           simulation grid.
%
%   rhoO  - Oil density in each cell.
%
%   p     - Oil phase pressure. One value per cell in simulation grid.
%           Should be unmodified. Included simply to have parity with
%           analogous gas and water functions.
%
%   upco  - Upwind indicators for the oil phase. One value per interface.
%
%   dpO   - Phase pressure differential for each interface. Was used to
%           evaluate the phase flux.
