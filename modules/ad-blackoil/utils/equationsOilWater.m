function [problem, state] = equationsOilWater(state0, state, model, dt, drivingForces, varargin)
% Generate linearized problem for the two-phase oil-water model
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [problem, state] = equationsOilWater(state0, state, model, dt, drivingForces)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This is the core function of the two-phase oil-water solver. This
%   function assembles the residual equations for the conservation of water
%   and oil as well as required well equations. By default, Jacobians are
%   also provided by the use of automatic differentiation.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   state0    - Reservoir state at the previous timestep. Assumed to have
%               physically reasonable values.
%
%   state     - State at the current nonlinear iteration. The values do not
%               need to be physically reasonable.
%
%   model     - TwoPhaseOilWaterModel-derived class. Typically,
%               equationsOilWater will be called from the class
%               getEquations member function.
%
%   dt        - Scalar timestep in seconds.
%
%   drivingForces - Struct with fields:
%                   * W for wells. Can be empty for no wells.
%                   * bc for boundary conditions. Can be empty for no bc.
%                   * src for source terms. Can be empty for no sources.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   'Verbose'    -  Extra output if requested.
%
%   'reverseMode'- Boolean indicating if we are in reverse mode, i.e.
%                  solving the adjoint equations. Defaults to false.
%
%   'resOnly'    - Only assemble residual equations, do not assemble the
%                  Jacobians. Can save some assembly time if only the
%                  values are required.
%
%   'iterations' - Nonlinear iteration number. Special logic happens in the
%                  wells if it is the first iteration.
% RETURNS:
%   problem - LinearizedProblemAD class instance, containing the water
%             and oil conservation equations, as well as well equations
%             specified by the WellModel class.
%
%   state   - Updated state. Primarily returned to handle changing well
%             controls from the well model.
