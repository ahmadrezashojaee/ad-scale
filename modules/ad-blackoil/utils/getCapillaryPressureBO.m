function [pcOW, pcOG] = getCapillaryPressureBO(fluid, sW, sG)
%Compute oil-water and oil-gas capillary pressures
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [pcOW, pcOG] = getCapillaryPressureBO(f, sW, sG)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Compute the capillary pressures relative to the oil pressure
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   fluid     - AD fluid model, from for example initDeckADIFluid or
%               initSimpleADIFluid.
%
%   sW        - Water saturation. Used to evaluate the water-oil capillary
%               pressure.
%
%   sG        - Gas saturation. Used to evaluate the oil-gas capillary
%               pressure.
% RETURNS:
%   pcOW - Pressure difference between the oil and water pressures. The
%          water phase pressure can be computed as
%          pW = pO - pcOW;
%
%   pcOG - Pressure difference between the oil and gas pressures. The
%          water phase pressure can be computed as
%          pG = pO + pcOG;
%
% NOTE:
%     Mind the different sign for the computation of the phase pressures
%     above!
