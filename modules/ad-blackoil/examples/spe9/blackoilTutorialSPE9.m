%% Ninth Comparative Solution Project
% This example runs the model from the SPE9 benchmark, which was posed
% twenty years ago to compare contemporary black-oil simulators (Killough,
% 1995). The reservoir is described by a 24 × 25 × 15 grid, having a 10
% degree dipping-angle in the x-direction. By current standards, the model
% is quite small, but contains a few features that will still pose
% challenges for black-oil simulators. The 25 producers initially operate
% at a maximum rate of 1500 STBO/D, which is lowered to 100 STBO/D from day
% 300 to 360, and then raised up again to its initial value until the end
% of simulation at 900 days. The single water injector is set to a maximum
% rate of 5000 STBW/D with a maximum bottom-hole pressure of 4000 psi at
% reference depth. This setup will cause free gas to form after ~100 days
% when the reservoir pressure is reduced below the original saturation
% pressure. The free gas migrates to the top of the reservoir. During the
% simulation most of the wells convert from rate control to pressure
% control. A second problem is a discontinuity in the water-oil capillary
% pressure curve, which may cause difficulties in the Newton solver when
% saturations are changing significantly.
%
% In this comprehensive example, we will discuss the various parameters
% that enter the model and show how to set up state-of-the-art simulation
% using a CPR preconditioner with algebraic multigrid solver.

%% Set up model
% This <Ninth SPE Comparative Solution Project> consists of a water
% injection problem in a highly heterogenous reservoir. There is one
% injector and 25 producers. The problem is set up to be solved using a
% black-oil model. The data set we provide is a modified version of input
% files belonging to the <http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TPG4535
% course in reservoir engineering and petrophysics> at NTNU (Trondheim,
% Norway) and available at
% <http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~kleppe/pub/SPE-COMPARATIVE/ECLIPSE_DATA/>.
%
% We have put most of the boilerplate setup into the setupSPE9 function.

[G, rock, fluid, deck, state0] = setupSPE9();

% Determine the model automatically from the deck. It should be a
% three-phase black oil model with gas dissoluton.
model = selectModelFromDeck(G, rock, fluid, deck);

% Show the model
model %#ok, intentional display

% Convert the deck schedule into a MRST schedule by parsing the wells
schedule = convertDeckScheduleToMRST(model, deck);

%% Adjust time-step control
% To ensure more stable time stepping, we set limits on changes in Rs,
% pressure, and saturation
model.drsMaxRel = inf;
model.dpMaxRel  = .1;
model.dsMaxAbs  = .1;

%% Configure linear solver
% We proceed to setup a CPR-type solver with the best available pressure
% solver. The CPR preconditioner attempts to decouple the fully implicit
% equation set into a pressure component and a transport component.
%
% The pressure is mathematically elliptic/parabolic in nature, and
% multigrid is well suited for solving these highly coupled, challenging
% problems. The remainder of the linear system, corresponding to the
% hyperbolic part of the equations is localized in nature and is primarily
% concerned with moving the saturation between neighboring grid blocks.
%
% Setting up a preconditioner is not strictly required to solve this
% problem, as the 9000 cells for a three-phase system results in linear
% systems with 27000 unknowns (one equation per phase, per cell). However,
% it does improve the solution speed and is required for larger cases,
% where Matlab's standard linear solvers scale poorly.
linsolve = selectLinearSolverAD(model);

%% Plot the rock permeability
% The SPE9 data set has an anisotropic, inhomogenous permeability field.
% The vertical permeability is 1/10th of the horizontal values. We plot the
% permeability using a log10 transform to better see the contrast.

% While the grid is structured, the grid has varying cell size along the
% vertical axis. To show this in detail, we plot the porosity in a single
% column of cells. We get the underlying logical grid and extract the
% subset corresponding to the first column (upper left corner of the grid).
%
% By using axis equal we see the actual aspect ratio of the cells.

%% Plot initial saturation of oil and water
% Initially, the reservoir does not contain free gas. We plot the initial
% saturations using the RGB plotting feature, where a three column matrix
% sent to plotCellData is interpreted column wise as fractions of red,
% green and blue respectively. Since MRST convention is to order the phases
% in the order WOG we need to permute the column index slightly to get red
% oil, blue water and green gas.

%% Examine gas dissolved in oil phase
% Even though there is no free gas initially, there is significant amounts
% of gas dissolved in the oil phase. The dissolved gas will bubble into
% free gas when the pressure drops below the bubble point pressure. For a
% given pressure there is a fixed amount of gas that can be dissolved in
% the black-oil instantanous dissolution model. To illustrate how saturated
% the initial conditions are, we plot the function
%
% $$ g(p) = \frac{R_s}{R_s^{sat}(p)}  $$
%
% I.e. how close the oil phase is to being completely saturated for the
% current pressure. A value near one means that the liquid is close to
% saturated and any values above one will immediately lead to free gas
% appearing in the simulation model.
%
% As we can see from the figure, free gas will appear very quickly should
% the pressure drop.

%% Plot the wells
% Since there is a large number of wells, we plot the wells without
% any labels and simply color the injector in blue and the producers in
% red.
W = schedule.control(1).W;
sgn = [W.sign];

axis tight off; view(v)
set(gca,'Projection','Perspective');

%% Examine the schedule
% The simulation schedule consists of three control periods. All 26 wells
% are present during the entire simulation, but their prescribed rates will
% change. The injector is injecting a constant water rate, while the
% producers all produce a constant oil rate, letting bottom hole pressures
% and gas/water production vary. Since all producers have the same
% controls, we can examine PROD2 in detail. We plot the controls, showing
% that the well rate drops sharply midway during the simulation

wno = find(strcmp({schedule.control(1).W.name}, 'PROD2'));

% Extract controls for all timesteps
P = arrayfun(@(ctrl) schedule.control(ctrl).W(wno).val, schedule.step.control);
T = cumsum(schedule.step.val);

%% Examine well limits
% Note that the well controls are not the only way of controlling a well.
% Limits can be imposed on wells, either due to physical or mathematical
% considerations. In this case, fixed oil rate is the default setting,
% but the well will switch controls if the pressure drops below a
% threshold. This is found in the lims field for each well.
%
% Since this is a producer, the bhp limit is considered a lower limit,
% whereas a bhp limit for an injector would be interpreted as a maximum
% limit to avoid either equipment failure or formation of rock fractures.

%% Plot relative permeability curves
% For a three-phase model we have four relative permeability curves. One
% for both gas and water and two curves for the oil phase. The oil relative
% permeability is tabulated for both water-oil and oil-gas systems, and as
% we can see from the following plot, this gives a number of kinks that
% will tend to pose challenges for the Newton solver.

%% Plot capillary pressure curves

% between oil and gas and another for the water-oil contact.

%% Plot compressibility
% The black-oil model treats fluid compressibility through tabulated
% functions often referred to as formation volume factors (or B-factors).
% To find the mass of a given volume at a specific reservoir pressure
% $p_R$, we write
%
% $$ M_\alpha = V_R \rho_\alpha^s b_\alpha (p_R) $$
%
% where $\alpha$ refers to either the phase, V_R the volume occupied at
% reservoir conditions and $\rho_\alpha^s$ is the surface / reference
% density when the B-factor is 1.
%
% Note that MRST by convention only uses small b to describe fluid models.
% The relation between B and b is simply the reciprocal $b = 1/B$ and will
% be calculated when needed.
%
% We begin by plotting the B-factors/compressibility for the water and gas
% phases. Note that the water compressibility is minimal, as water is close
% to incompressible in most models. The gas compressibility varies several
% orders of magnitude.
%
% The rock compressibility is included as well. Rock compressibility is
% modelling the poroelastic expansion of the pore volume available for
% flow. As the rock itself shrinks, more fluid can fit inside it.
%
% Note that although the curves shown in this particular case are all
% approximately linear, there is no such requirement on the fluid model.

%% Plot oil compressibility
% Since we allow the gas phase to dissolve into the oil phase,
% compressibility does not only depend on the pressure: The amount of
% dissolved gas will also change how much the fluid can be compressed.
%
% We handle this by having saturated and undersatured tables for the
% formation volume factors (FVF). This is reflected in the figure:
% Unsaturated FVF curves will diverge into from the main downwards sloping
% trend into almost constant curves sloping downwards.
%
% Physically, the undersaturated oil will swell as more gas is being
% introduced into the oil, increasing the volume more than the pressure
% decreases the volume of the oil itself. When the oil is completely
% saturated, the volume decrease is due to the gas-oil mixture itself being
% compressed.

%% Plot the viscosity
% The viscosity can also depend on the pressure and dissolved components in
% a similar manner as the compressibility. Again, we note that the water
% phase is unaffected by the pressure, the gas changes viscosity quite a
% bit. As with $b_o$, the oil viscosibility depends more on the amount of
% dissolved gas than the pressure itself and we have undersatured tables to
% show.
%
% SPE9 only allows gas to dissolve into oil, and not the other way around.
% Generally, the black-oil model is a pseudo-compositional model where both
% gas in oil ($R_v$) and oil in gas ($R_v$) can be included.
