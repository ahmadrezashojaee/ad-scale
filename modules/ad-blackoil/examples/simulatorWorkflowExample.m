%% Workflow example for MRST-AD
% This example aims to show the complete workflow for creating, running and
% analyzing a simulation model. Unlike the other examples, we will create
% all features of the model manually to get a self-contained script without
% any input files required.
%
% The model we setup is a slightly compressible two-phase oil/water model
% with multiple wells. The reservoir has a layered strategraphy and
% contains four intersecting faults.
%
% Note that this example features a simple conceptual model designed to
% show the workflow rather than a problem representing a realistic scenario
% in terms of well locations and fluid physics.

%% Reservoir geometry and petrophysical properties
% We begin by setting up the grid and rock structures. The grid is created
% by "makeModel3", which creates a structured model with intersecting
% faults. We assume a layered permeability structure with 300, 100, and 500
% md in the lower, middle, and top layers. respectively.

% Define grid
grdecl = makeModel3([50, 50, 5], [1000, 1000, 5]*meter);
G = processGRDECL(grdecl);
G = computeGeometry(G);

% Set up permeability based on K-indices
[I, J, K] = gridLogicalIndices(G);

top = K < G.cartDims(3)/3;
lower = K > 2*G.cartDims(3)/3;
middle = ~(lower | top);

px = ones(G.cells.num, 1);
px(lower) = 300*milli*darcy;
px(middle) = 100*milli*darcy;
px(top) = 500*milli*darcy;

% Introduce anisotropy by setting K_x = 10*K_z.
perm = [px, px, 0.1*px];
rock = makeRock(G, perm, 0.3);

%% Define wells and simulation schedule
% Hydrocarbon is recovered from producers, operating at fixed bottom-hole
% pressure and perforated throughout all layers of the model. The producers
% are supported by a single water injector set to inject one pore volume
% over 10 years (the total simulation length). We also set up a schedule
% consisting of 5 small control steps initially, followed by 25 larger
% steps. We keep the well controls fixed throughout the simulation.

%% Set up simulation model
% We set up a two-phase oil-water simulation model based on automatic
% differentiation. The resulting object is a special case of a general
% three-phase model and to instantiate it, we start by constructing a
% two-phase fluid structure with properties given for oil and water. Water
% is assumed to be incompressible, whereas oil has constant
% compressibility, giving a reciprocal formation volume factor of the form,
% $b_o(p) = b_0 exp[c (p - p_0)]$. To define this relation, we set the 'bo'
% field of the fluid structure to be an anonymous function that calls the
% builtin 'exp' function with appropriate arguments. Since the fluid model is a
% struct containing function handles, it is simple to modify the fluid to use
% alternate functions. We then pass the fundamental structures (grid, rock and
% fluid) onto the two-phase oil/water model constructor.

% Three-phase template model
fluid = initSimpleADIFluid('mu',    [1, 5]*centi*poise, ...
                           'rho',   [1000, 700]*kilogram/meter^3, ...

%% Define initial state
% Once we have a model, we need to set up an initial state. We set up a
% very simple initial state; we let the bottom part of the reservoir be
% completely water filled, and the top completely oil filled. MRST uses
% water, oil, gas ordering internally, so in this case we have water in the
% first column and oil in the second for the saturations.

%% Simulate base case
% Using the schedule giving dynamic controls and time steps, the model
% giving the mathematical description of how to advance the solution, and
% the initial state of the reservoir, we can simulate the problem. Since
% the simulation will consume some time, we launch a progress report and
% a plotting tool for the well solutions (well rates and bottom-hole
% pressures)

%% Create an upscaled, coarser model
% The fine scale model has approximately 10000 cells. If we want a smaller

% uniform partition of approximately 50 cells based on the IJK-indices of
% the grid.

%% Split blocks over the faultlines
% We see that several coarse blocks cross the fault lines. To get
% hexahedral coarse blocks, we create a grid where the faults act as
% barriers and apply the "processPartition" routine to split any coarse
% blocks intersected by faults.
%
% Afterwards, we show the new partition and highlight blocks created due to
% the modification of the fault.

%% Upscale the model and run the coarser problem
% We can now directly upscale the model, schedule, and initial state. By
% default, the upscaling routine uses the simplest possible options, i.e.,
% harmonic averaging of permeabilities. It is possible to use more advanced
% options, but for the purpose of this example we will use the defaults.
%
% Once we have an upscaled model, we can again simulate the new schedule
% and observe that the time taken is greatly reduced. For instance, on a
% Intel Core i7 desktop computer, the fine model takes little under a
% minute to run, while the upscaled model takes 4 seconds.

%% Plot the coarse results, and compare the well solutions
% We plot the coarse solutions and compare the well solutions. Note that
% the upscaling will result in only 70 cells, which is unlikely to give
% good results with only simple harmonic averaging of permeabilities as
% used in the first upscaling. The flow-based upscaling gives much better
% result, but is dependent on having access to the well configuration.
