%% Gravity segregation using two phase AD solvers
% This example demonstrates a simple, but classical test problem for a
% multiphase solver. The problem we are considering is that of gravity
% segregation: For a given domain, we let the initial fluid distribution
% consist of a dense fluid atop of a lighter one. Gravity is the only
% active force, and bouyancy will over time force the reservoir towards a
% stable equilibrium in which the denser fluid has switched place with the
% lighter fluid.
%
% The example also demonstrates how to set up a simple schedule (one or
% more timesteps with a collection of driving forces such as bc and wells).

%% Reservoir geometry and petrophysical properties
% We begin by defining a simple homogenous reservoir of 1 by 1 by 5 meters
% and 250 simulation cells.
dims = [5 5 10]; 
G = cartGrid(dims, [1, 1, 5]*meter);
G = computeGeometry(G);

rock = makeRock(G, 100*milli*darcy, 0.5);

%% Defining the fluid properties
% In this section, we set up a generic fluid suitable for solvers based on
% automatic differentiation. The fluid model is by default incompressible.
% We define two phases: Oil and water with significant differences in
% density and viscosity.
fluid = initSimpleADIFluid('phases', 'WO', ...
                           'mu', [1, 10]*centi*poise, ...
                           'n',  [1, 1], ...
                           'rho', [1000, 700]*kilogram/meter^3);
                        
%% Defining the model
% The model object contains all functions necessary to simulate a
% mathematical model using the AD-solvers. In our case, we are interested
% in a standard fully implicit two-phase oil/water model. By passing the
% grid, rock, and fluid into the model constructor we obtain a model with
% precomputed operators and quantities that can be passed on to the
% simulator. We also ensure that gravity is enabled *before* we call the
% constructor.
gravity reset on
model = TwoPhaseOilWaterModel(G, rock, fluid);

% Show the model
disp(model)

%% Set up initial state
% We must also define the initial state. The state contains the unstable
% initial fluid distribution. We do this by setting the water saturation to
% 1 in all cells and then setting it to zero in cells below a datum point. 
%
% We defined the water (first phase) density to be 1000 kg/m^3 when we set
% up the fluid model. Note that we let the pressure be uniform initially.
% The model is relatively simple, so we do not need to worry about the
% initial pressure being reasonable, but this is something that should be
% considered more carefullly for models with e.g., compressibility.
%
% To ensure that we got the distribution right, we make a plot of the
% initial saturation.
[ii, jj, kk] = gridLogicalIndices(G);

lower = kk > 5;
sW = ones(G.cells.num, 1);
sW(lower) = 0;
s = [sW, 1 - sW];

% Finally set up the state
state = initResSol(G, 100*barsa, s);

% Plot the initial water saturation

%% Set up boundary conditions and timesteps
% Finally, we add a simple boundary condition of 100 bar pressure at the
% bottom of the reservoir. This is not strictly required, but the
% incompressible model will produce singular linear systems if we do not
% fix the pressure somehow. It is well known that the pressure is not
% unique for an incompressible model if there are no Dirichlet boundary
% conditions, as multiple pressures will give the same velocity field.
%
% Another alternative would be to add (some) compressibility to our fluid
% model.
%
% Once we have set up the boundary conditions, we define 20 timesteps of 90
% days each, which is enough for the state to approach equilibrium. The
% simulator will cut timesteps if they do not converge, so we are not
% overly worried about the large initial timestep when the problem is the
% most stiff.
%
% Finally, we combine the timesteps and the boundary conditions into a
% schedule. A schedule collects multiple timesteps into a single struct and
% makes it easier to have for example different boundary conditions at
% different time periods. For this example, however, the schedule is very
% simple.
%
bc = [];
bc = pside(bc, G, 'ZMin', 100*barsa, 'sat', [0 1]);

dt = repmat(90*day, 20, 1);

schedule = simpleSchedule(dt, 'bc', bc);

%% Simulate the problem
% Finally, we simulate the problem. We note that the three simple objects
% define the entire simulation:
% - state defines the initial values in the reservoir
% - model defines the partial differential equations, their physical
% constraints and the numerical discretizations required to advance from
% one time to the next.
% - schedule defines any time dependent input parameters as well as the
% timesteps.
[wellSols, states] = simulateScheduleAD(state, model, schedule, 'Verbose', true);

%% Plot the segregation process
% We finish by plotting the water saturation at each timestep, showing how
% the lighter fluid migrates upward and the heavier fluid downward.
