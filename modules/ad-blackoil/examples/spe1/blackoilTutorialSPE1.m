%% The Odeh Benchmark (SPE1) 
% The first SPE project comparing black-oil reservoir simulators was
% organized by Odeh (1981) and describes a depletion problem with gas
% injection in a small 10x10x3 reservoir with a producer and an injector
% placed in diagonally opposite corners. The porosity is uniform and equal
% 0.3, whereas the permeability is isotropic with values 500, 50, and 200
% md in the three layers with thickness 20, 30, and 50 ft. The reservoir is
% initially undersaturated with a pressure field that is constant in each
% layer, a uniform mixture of water (Sw = 0.12) and oil (So = 0.88) with no
% initial free gas (Sg = 0.0) and a constant dissolved gas-oil ratio (Rs )
% throughout the model.
%
% The problem is specified using an industry-standard input format, and the
% solution computed by MRST is compared to that of a commercial reservoir 
% simulator (Eclipse 100). The original problem was posed to study ten
% years of production; herein, we only report and compare solutions for the
% first 1216 days.

%% Set up the problem
% Because several examples use the SPE1 dataset, the initial setup is
% delegated to a helper function. See the inside for documentation.
[G, rock, fluid, deck, state] = setupSPE1();

% Determine the model automatically from the deck. It should be a
% three-phase black oil model with gas dissoluton.
model = selectModelFromDeck(G, rock, fluid, deck);

% Convert the deck schedule into a MRST schedule by parsing the wells
schedule = convertDeckScheduleToMRST(model, deck);

%% Plot well and permeability
% The permeability consists of three layers going from high to low
% permeability along the z axis. The wells are completed in the upper and
% lower layer for the injector and producer respectively. To get a well
% object, we simply process the first control from the schedule.

plotWell(G, schedule.control(1).W, 'radius',.5); % Pick the only well control present

axis tight, view(35, 40), colorbar('SouthOutside');

%% Run the entire schedule
% Here, we will run the schedule as it is described in the input file. Note
% that a schedule is not necessary to solve problems using the fully 
% implicit solver. The function 'solvefiADI' from the 'ad-fi' module (which
% implements fully implicit ad solvers *without* object orientation) is
% capable of taking a well structure directly and solve for a single time
% step in a manner similar e.g., to the incompressible MRST solvers.
% schedule.step.val(1) = 10*year;
nls = NonLinearSolver('useLinesearch', true);
[wellSols, states, report] = simulateScheduleAD(state, model, schedule, 'nonlinearsolver', nls);

%% Plot the well solutions and simulator states
% We setup interactive viewers for both well solutions and the reservoir
% states.
plotWellSols(wellSols, report.ReservoirTime)

%% Make plots to compare solution with a commercial simulator
% Load summary from binary file and find indices of the producer and
% injector.
load SPE1_smry

inj = find([wellSols{1}.sign] == 1);
prod = find([wellSols{1}.sign] == -1);

% Since there are zero values in the first step of the summary, we ignore
% the first entry to get better plot axes.
ind = 2:size(smry.data,2);

% Put the well solution data into a format more suitable for plotting
[qWs, qOs, qGs, bhp] = wellSolToVector(wellSols);

% Get timesteps for both the reference and the MRST solution
T = convertTo(cumsum(schedule.step.val), year);
Tcomp =  smry.get(':+:+:+:+', 'YEARS', ind);


%% Plot producer gas/oil ratio
% The most interesting part of the SPE1 case is the gas/oil ratio at the
% producer. We convert the field units and plot the dimensionless ratio.
% As should be apparent from the figure, the implicit solver is able to
% qualitatively reproduce the same outflow profile.
