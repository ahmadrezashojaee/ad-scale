Models and examples that extend the MRST AD-OO framework found in the ad-core module to black-oil problems. More specifically, the module adds additional models that implement the black-oil equations for multiphase, miscible, compressible flow. Included in the module are also a wide variety of examples validating the solvers against a commercial simulator on standard test cases.

The module includes single-phase, two-phase and three-phase solvers. The three-phase solvers has optional support for problems where gas can dissolve into oil (Rs) and/or oil can vaporize into the gas phase (Rv). The solvers support source terms, boundary conditions and complex wells with changing controls, production limits and multiple segments. Standard benchmark cases (SPE1, SPE9) are included together with comparison results from a commercial simulator.
