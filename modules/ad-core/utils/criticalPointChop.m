function x_final = criticalPointChop(x0, x_final, xc, e, type, dir)
%Perform one or two-sided stability chop for an updated value
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   x = criticalPointChop(x, x+dx, xc, e)
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   x0       - Quantity before update.
%
%   x        - Quantity after update
%
%   xc      - Critical point
%
%   e       - Epsilon used for stability
%
%   type    - If provided, indicates the type of chop: Above will chop so
%             that the passed value is on the other side of the critical
%             point, below the opposite and both will chop in both
%             directions. Default: Both
%
%   dir     - Direction that will be chopped. Either any, increasing or
%             decreasing. Default: Any, chop both increasing and decreasing
%             quantities.
% RETURNS:
%   x_final - Chopped value.
