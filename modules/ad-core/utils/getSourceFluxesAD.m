%Short description
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [qSurf, BCTocellMap, cells] = getSourceFluxesAD(model, mob, b, s, src)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model          - Subclass of ReservoirModel indicating which phases are
%                    active.
%
%   mob            - A cell array of cell mobility values for all active
%                    phases.
%
%
%   s              - A cell array of saturations per cell for all active
%                    phases.
%
%   src            - Source struct as defined by addSource
%
% RETURNS:
%   qSurf           - Source terms at standard conditions. Cell array of
%                   same dimensions as the number of active phases.
%
%   cells          - A list of cells for which the entries of qRes should
%                    be added.
