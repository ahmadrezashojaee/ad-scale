function [qWs, qOs, qGs, bhp] = wellSolToVector(wellsols)
%Extract selected summary vectors from cell array of well solutions
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [WaterRate, OilRate, GasRate, BHP] = wellSolToVector(wellSols)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   wellSols - Cell array of well solution structures as produced by
%              runScheduleADI or simulateScheduleADI.  Each solution
%              structure must define the fields 'qWs', 'qOs', 'qGs', and
%              'bhp'.
%
% NOTE:
%   Function wellSolToVector does not support variable number of wells.
%
% RETURNS:
%   In the following 'nw' refers to the number of wells
%   (NUMEL(wellSols{1})) while 'nt' refers to the total number of time
%   steps (NUMEL(wellSols)).
%
%   WaterRate - Numeric array of size nt-by-nw of water rate at surface
%               conditions (unit m^3/s).
%
%   OilRate   - Numeric array of size nt-by-nw of oil rate at surface
%               conditions (unit m^3/s).
%
%   GasRate   - Numeric array of size nt-by-nw of gas rate at surface
%               conditions (unit m^3/s).
%
%   BHP       - Numeric array of size nt-by-nw of well bottom-hole pressure
%               values (unit Pascal).
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   simulateScheduleADI, runScheduleADI.
