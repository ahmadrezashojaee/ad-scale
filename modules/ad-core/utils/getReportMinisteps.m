function timesteps = getReportMinisteps(report)
% Get the timesteps used for the ministeps of a report
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   timesteps = getReportMinisteps(report)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Get the actual ministeps used by simulateScheduleAD.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   report - Report from simulateScheduleAD. 
%
% RETURNS:
%   timesteps - The timesteps used to solve the problem. These differ from
%               the control steps (schedule.step.val) in that they are the
%               actual timesteps taken by the solver (due to timestep
%               cutting, adaptive timestepping and so on)
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   SimulateScheduleAD
