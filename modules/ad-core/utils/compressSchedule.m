function scheduleCompressed = compressSchedule(schedule)
% Compress schedule to take the longest possible timesteps while honoring controls
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   schedule = compressSchedule(schedule)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Take a already defined schedule and combine all successive timesteps
%   with the same controls. This is useful to make a schedule suitable for
%   dynamic timestepping, as the control steps correspond only to the hard
%   limits set by changing well/bc controls.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%
%   scheduleDeck - A deck struct, typically from convertDeckScheduleToMRST
%                  or manually created. 
%
% RETURNS:
%   scheduleCompressed - Schedule ready for simulation in 'simulateScheduleAD'.
