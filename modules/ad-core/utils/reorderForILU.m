function [A, b] = reorderForILU(A, b, nc)
%Attempt to reorder a set of equations so that the diagonal is non-zero
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [A, b] = reorderForILU(A, b, nc);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Reorder a set of equations to ensure non-zero diagonal. This is useful
%   when building ILU-based solvers. Notably, this utility is useful
%   whenever well equations are added, that may not have derivatives with
%   respect to all well controls.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   A  - Linear system to be reordered.
%   b  - Right hand side of the system
%   nc - (OPTIONAL) The routine will only look at equations from nc+1 and
%        onwards to numel(b). 
% RETURNS:
%   A  - Reordered linear system
%   b  - Reordered right hand side
