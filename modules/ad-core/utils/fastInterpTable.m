function yi = fastInterpTable(X, Y, xi)
% Fast interpolation of table, using griddedInterpolant
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   yi = fastInterpTable(X, Y, xi)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   A simple wrapper for griddedInterpolant for fast interpolation of
%   simple data in the AD-framework. Always defaults to linear
%   interpolation with linear extrapolation.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   x  - Sample X-coordinates
%
%   y  - Sample function values
%
%   xi - The X-coordinates at which the linear interpolant is to be
%        evaluated.
%
% RETURNS:
%   yi - Linear function interpolating (x, y) evaluated at xi.
