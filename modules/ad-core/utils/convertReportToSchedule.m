function [schedule, timesteps] = convertReportToSchedule(report, schedule)
% Create a new schedule based on actual ministeps from a simulation report
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   schedule = convertReportToSchedule(report, schedule)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Running a simulation schedule with a given set of control steps may
%   lead to several extra timesteps due to time step cutting/adjustments
%   done by the nonlinear solver. This utility converts the report output
%   from 'simulateScheduleAD' along with the schedule used into a new
%   schedule that accounts for ministeps actually taken.
%
%   Note that 'simulateScheduleAD' MUST be called with the option
%   'OutputMinisteps' set to true for this to do anything, otherwise it
%   will just output the report steps.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   report   - Report from 'simulateScheduleAD' with 'OutputMinisteps' set
%              to true.
%
%   schedule - The schedule used to produce the report.
%
% RETURNS:
%   schedule - New schedule modified so that the ministeps are accounted
%              for.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   simulateScheduleAD
