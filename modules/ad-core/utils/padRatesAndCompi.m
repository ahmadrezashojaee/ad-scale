function [q_new, W, isActive] = padRatesAndCompi(q_s, W, model)
% Pad one/two/threephase values with zeros corresponding to missing phases.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [q, W] = padRatesAndCompi(q, W, model);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function adds padding zeros to convert rates and wells for a
%   one/two phase model to make it appear as a three phase model with zero
%   rates for the missing phases.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   q_s          - Cell array of fluxes corresponding to the number of
%                  active phases in the model.
%
%   W            - Wells compatible with the current model.
%
%   model        - Model with one or more active phases, consistent with
%                  q_s and W.
%
% RETURNS:
%
%   q_s          - 1 by 3 cell array with zero values added for missing
%                  phases.
%
%   W            - Three phase wells (.compi contains three fields, again
%                   with zeros where phases are missing in the original
%                   model).
%
%   isActive     - Indicators for which phases are present.
