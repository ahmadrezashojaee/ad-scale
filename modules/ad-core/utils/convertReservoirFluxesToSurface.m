function states = convertReservoirFluxesToSurface(model, states)
%Compute surface fluxes from reservoir fluxes
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   states = convertReservoirFluxesToSurface(model, states)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function, given states with .bfactors and .flux, will compute the
%   surface/standard condition fluxes and place them under the field
%   surfaceFlux. To ensure bfactors and fluxes are added to states during a
%   simulation, enable the flag "model.extraStateOutput" before simulating.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model   - ReservoirModel subclass used to produce the states.
%
%   states  - States with valid fields .flux and .bfactors.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   states  - States with additional field surfaceFlux.
