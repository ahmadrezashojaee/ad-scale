function times = getSimulationTime(states, report)
%Get the global time for a set of states produced by simulateScheduleAD
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   times = getSimulationTime(states, report)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Get the time for each state output by simulateScheduleAD.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   states     - Cell array of states as given by simulateScheduleAD. Can
%                be either per control step or per ministep.
%
%   report     - Report given by simulateScheduleAD.
%
% RETURNS:
%   times      - Array with same dimensions as states, giving the values of
%                the time in the simulation model for each step. The
%                initial state passed to simulateScheduleAD is assumed to
%                be at time zero.
