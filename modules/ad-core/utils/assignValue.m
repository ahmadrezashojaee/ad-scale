function x = assignValue(x, v, inx)
% Assign values to ADI object by way of indices, without changing jacobians
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   x = assignValue(x, v, inx)
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Replace the numerical values of a ADI or double, without changing the
%   Jacobians. This can lead to inconsistent Jacobians and variables so it
%   should only be used if you really know what you are doing!
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   x - ADI or double where values are to be replaced.
%
%   v - Values that will replace some subset of x.
%
% inx - The indices into x that v will replace. That is, after the call, 
%       double(x(ix)) == v
%
% RETURNS:
%   x - Modified version of input with same class.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   ADI
