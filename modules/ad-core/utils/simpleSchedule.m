function schedule = simpleSchedule(dt, varargin)
%Make a schedule with varying timesteps and fixed wells/bc/src terms
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   schedule = simpleSchedule(timesteps);
%   schedule = simpleSchedule(timesteps, 'W', W, 'src', src, 'bc', bc);
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   
%   dt    - Vector (column/row) of desired timesteps.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   W -  Wells to be used in the schedule. The wells will be active in
%        all timesteps.
%   
%   BC - Boundary conditions to be used in the schedule. The boundary
%        conditions will be active in all timesteps. 
%
%   src - Source terms to be used in the schedule. The sourceterms will be
%        active in all timesteps.
%
% RETURNS:
%   schedule - struct suitable for further modification, or for input to
%              `simulateScheduleAD`.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `simulateScheduleAD`
