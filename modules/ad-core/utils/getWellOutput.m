function [welldata, wellnames, fldnames] = getWellOutput(wellsols, fldnames, wells, index)
%Extract values from wellsols.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [wd, wn, flds]= getWellOutput(wellSols, 'bhp')
%   [wd, wn, flds]= getWellOutput(wellSols, {'bhp', 'qWs'}, 'W1')
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Given a cell array of well solution structures representing multiple
%   timesteps, this routine extracts requested values in matrix form ready
%   for plotting / inspection.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   wellSols - Cell array of NSTEP length, each containing a struct with
%              NWELL entries. All wells must exist at all timesteps.
%                
%   fldnames - (OPTIONAL) Either a single string, or a cell array of
%              desired fields for output. Bottom hole pressures, rates, ...
%              Defaults to all fields.
%
%   wells    - (OPTIONAL) Either a single string, or a cell array of well
%              names for which output is desired. Defaults to all wells.
% RETURNS:
%   welldata - A NSTEP by NWELL by NFIELDS matrix. For instance, for
%   calling
%
%   D = getWellOutput(wellsols, {'bhp', 'qWs'}, {'Injector', 'Producer'})
%   
%   will give bottom hole pressures for the producer in D(:, 1, 2);
%
