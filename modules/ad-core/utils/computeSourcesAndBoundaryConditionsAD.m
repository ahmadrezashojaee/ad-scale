function [src, bc] = computeSourcesAndBoundaryConditionsAD(model, pressure, s, mob, rho, dissolved, forces)
%Compute phase-pseudocomponent source terms (compatible with AD codes)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [src, bc] = computeSourcesAndBoundaryConditionsAD(model, pressure, s, mob, rho, dissolved, forces)
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model     - Subclass of ReservoirModel for which the source terms are
%               to be computed.
%   pressure  - Reservoir pressures (cell array, one pressure per phase)
%   s         - Phase saturations (cell array, one saturation per phase)
%   mob       - Phase mobilities (cell array, one mobilit per phase)
%   rho       - Phase densities (including contributions from dissolved
%               phases. For a black-oil style model, this is
%               rhoO = bO.*(rs*rhoGS + rhoOS), and not the pseudocomponent
%               density in the phase bO.*rhoOS!
%   dissolved - Dissolution matrix for the properties. See
%               `getDissolutionMatrix` in `ThreePhaseBlackOilModel`.
%   forces    - Struct containing standard MRST driving forces.
%               Specifically, this routine uses the src and bc fields. All
%               other fields are ignored. For well source terms, see the
%               `FacilityModel`.
%
% RETURNS:
%   src,bc  - Structs for sources and boundary conditions respectively.
%             Each struct uses the same format with the following fields:
%                 'phaseMass'    - Cell array of mass source terms per
%                 phase pseudocomponent, accounting for dissolved fractions.
%                 'phaseVolume'  - Cell array of volumetric source terms
%                 per phase at reservoir conditions.
%                 'components'   - Empty cell array for inserting component
%                 source terms. Components are not the responsibility of
%                 this function, but we add the field to ensure that the
%                 structure is normalized.
%                 'mapping'      - Either empty or a matrix used to map the
%                 source terms into aggregate per-cell values. This matrix
%                 is required when multiple source terms are defined in the
%                 same block (e.g. two faces for a cell) since Matlab
%                 overwrites repeat indices instead of summing them.
%                 'sourceCells'  - List of cells the source terms should be
%                 added to.
%
% NOTE: 
%   The practical implementation of boundary conditions is normally done
%   through the gateway ReservoirModel>addBoundaryConditionsAndSources
%   routine, which uses this routine directly.
