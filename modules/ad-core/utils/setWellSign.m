function W = setWellSign(W)
%Ensure that wells have a defined sign. Will attempt to guess based on controls.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   W = setWellSign(W)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The AD based solvers assume a W.sign is defined. This routine attempts
%   to ensure that wells do have a sign. A positive sign is used to
%   indicate an injector and a negative sign for a producer. If the wells
%   have rate controls, they will be given signs based on the signs of the
%   rates. If they are pressure controlled wells, they will get sign 0.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   W  - Well struct, from e.g. addWell.
%
% RETURNS:
%   W  - Well struct where numel(W(i).sign) is guaranteed to be 1.
