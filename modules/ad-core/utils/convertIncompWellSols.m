function wellSols = convertIncompWellSols(W, states, incompFluid)
%Convert wellSols from incomp module to format used in ad-core/ad-blackoil
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   wellSols = convertIncompWellSols(W, states, fluid)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The solvers in the `incomp` module uses a different wellSol format than
%   the `ad-core` style wellSols. This function converts a set of states
%   into wellSols suitable for routines that were designed to work with the
%   `ad-core` style wellSols. Specifically, this enables the use of
%   getWellOutput and plotWellSols with solutions from the incompressible
%   solvers not based on AD.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   W           - Wells used for simulation
%
%   states      - Nstep long struct array of all simulation states.
%
%   incompFluid - Fluid model used to compute the simulation states.
%
% RETURNS:
%   wellSols    - Nstep long cell array of the same format as output by
%                 e.g. `simulateScheduleAD`
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `plotWellSols`, `getWellOutput`
