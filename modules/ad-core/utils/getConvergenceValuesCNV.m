function [values, names, tolerances, evaluated] = getConvergenceValuesCNV(model, problem)
% Compute convergence based on total mass balance and maximum residual mass balance.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [converged, values, evaluated] = CNV_MBConvergence(model, problem)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Compute CNV/MB type convergence similar to what is used for black
%   oil convergence in commercial simulators.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model      - Subclass of PhysicalModel. Strongly suggested to be
%                some black oil variant, as this convergence function
%                does *not* account for general residual convergence.
%
%   problem    - LinearizedProblem class instance we want to test for
%                convergence.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   convergence - Boolean indicating if the state used to produce the 
%                 LinearizedProblem has converged.
%                  
%   values      - 1 by 6 array containing mass balance in the first
%                 three terms followed by cnv in the last three. The
%                 phase ordering is assumed to be oil, water, gas.
%                 Phases present will return a zero in their place.
%
%   evaluated   - Logical array into problem.equations indicating which
%                 residual equations we have actually checked 
%                 convergence for.
%
%   names       - Cell array of same length as values with short names
%                 for printing/debugging.
