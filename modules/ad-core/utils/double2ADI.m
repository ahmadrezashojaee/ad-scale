function u = double2ADI(u, sample)
%Convert a double to ADI variable, using a sample ADI variable for dimensions
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   u = double2ADI(u, adivar)
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   u      - Double to be converted to ADI.
%
%   sample - Sample variable of the type ADI to be used.
% RETURNS:
%
%   u      - Variable with same type as sample and same value as u
%            initially had. If u is a ADI class instance, u will have zero
%            jacobians with the same number of primary variables as the
%            jacobians of sample.
