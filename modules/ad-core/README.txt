Object-oriented framework for solvers based on automatic differentiation (MRST AD-OO). This module by itself does not contain any complete simulators, but rather implements the common framework used for many other modules. For instance, the ad-blackoil module contains models for black-oil equations that inherit all basic features from ad-core, the ad-eor module inherits models from ad-blackoil, and so on.
