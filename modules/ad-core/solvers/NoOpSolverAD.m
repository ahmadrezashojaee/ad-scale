classdef NoOpSolverAD < LinearSolverAD
    % Linear solver that does nothing.
    %
    % SYNOPSIS:
    %   solver = NoOpSolverAD()
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   Debug solver. It has the correct interfaces, but it always returns zero
    %   as the solution for the problem. It is, however, very fast...
    %
    % NOTE:
    %   You should not use this solver.
    %
    % SEE ALSO:
    %   BackslashSolverAD
