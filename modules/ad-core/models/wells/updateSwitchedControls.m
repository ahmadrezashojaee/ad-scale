function [W, wells_shut] = updateSwitchedControls(wellSol, W, varargin)
%Update active well controls based on well solution structure
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [W, wells_shut] = updateSwitchedControls(sol, W)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Updates the well control structure based on the solution structure.
%   Typically, if a well has changed controls during a timestep, we want to
%   modify the controls for the next timestep accordingly. The purpose of
%   this function is twofold:
%           - Update the well controls based on limits
%           - Shut down any wells which have changed from injecting to
%           producing or vice versa.
%
%   Note that either feature can be enabled/disabled via keyword arguments.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   wellSol - Well sol struct, corresponding to the solution of a problem
%             using the current set of wells. The wellSol will contain
%             information about how the controls have changed during the
%             timestep.
%
%   W       - Wells used to produce wellSol.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   allowWellSignChange - Boolean indicating if wells are allowed to change
%                         between injection and production. Disabled by
%                         default (changing wells will be shut down until
%                         re-enabled by new controls).
%
%  allowControlSwitching- Boolean indicating if wells are allowed to change
%                         controls based om limits (W.lims). Default true.
%
% RETURNS:
%   W       - Wells with controls updated based on wellSol.
%
%   wells_shut - Boolean indicating if any wells were shut down due to
%                changing from injection to production or vice versa,
%                dependent on allowWellSignChange keyword argument.
