function packed = packPerforationProperties(W, p, mob, rho, dissolved, comp, wellvars, wellvarnames, varmaps, wellmap, ix)
% Extract variables corresponding to a specific well
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%  packed = packPerforationProperties(W, p, mob, rho, dissolved, comp, wellvars, wellvarnames, varmaps, wellmap, ix)
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%  W       - Well struct for the specific well under consideration.
%
%  p       - Reservoir pressure for all cells in the domain.
%
%  mob     - Cell array with phase mobilities in each cell in the
%            reservoir. Number of active phases long.
%
%  rho     - Cell array with phase densities in each cell in the
%            reservoir. Number of active phases long.
%
%  dissolved - Black-oil specific array of rs/rv. See the function
%            ThreePhaseBlackOilModel>getDissolutionMatrix
%            for details. Should be empty for models without dissolution
%            ratios.
%
%  comp    - Cell array of components. Each entry should contain all
%            reservoir cell values of that component, subject to whatever
%            ordering is natural for the model itself.
%
%  wellvars - Extended variable set added by the FacilityModel (see
%             SimpleWell>getExtraPrimaryVariables)
%
%  wellvarnames, varmaps, wellmap, ix - Internal book-keeping for
%  additional added primary variables.
%
% RETURNS:
%   packed - Struct where the values for the perforations of the well has
%            been extracted.
%
% NOTE: This function is intended for internal use in FacilityModel.
