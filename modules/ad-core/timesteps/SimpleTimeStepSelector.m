classdef SimpleTimeStepSelector < handle
    % Time step selector base class
    %
    % SYNOPSIS:
    %   selector = SimpleTimeStepSelector();
    %   selector = SimpleTimeStepSelector('maxTimestep', 5*day);
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   The timestep selector base class is called by the NonLinearSolver to
    %   determine timesteps, based on hard limits such as the min/max timesteps
    %   as well as possibly more advanced features via the computeTimestep
    %   method that can account for iteration count, residual reduction etc.
    %
    % REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
    %   None
    %
    % OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
    %   See properties
    %
    % RETURNS:
    %   selector suitable for passing to the NonLinearSolver class.

    properties
        history % Stored history used to pick next timestep
        maxTimestep % Hard upper limit on timestep in seconds
        minTimestep % Hard lower limit on timestep in seconds
        verbose % Extra output
        maxHistoryLength % The maximum number of history steps stored
        isStartOfCtrlStep % Flag indicating the beginning of a control step
        controlsChanged % Flag indicating that the controls have changed
        
        firstRampupStep % The first ministep attempted after controls have changed
        % Could be set to a low value to get the timestep controller started 
        % with some estimate of problem stiffness.
        % 
        firstRampupStepRelative % Relative version of firstRampupStep
        % (i.e. if timestep is 5*days, the ramp up step will then be
        % 5*days*firstRampupStepRelative.

        maxRelativeAdjustment % Ensure dt_next < dt_suggested*maxRelativeAdjustment
        minRelativeAdjustment % Ensure dt_next > dt_suggested*minRelativeAdjustment
        
        stepLimitedByHardLimits % Flag indicating that hard limits and not any step algorithm was the cause of the previous timestep taken
        previousControl % Previous control seen by the selector used to determine when controls change.
        resetOnControlsChanged % Reset when controls change
        isFirstStep % Flag indicating that we are at the start of the simulation
