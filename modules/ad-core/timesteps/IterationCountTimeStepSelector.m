classdef IterationCountTimeStepSelector < SimpleTimeStepSelector
    % Adjust timesteps based with target iteration count, based on history
    %
    % SYNOPSIS:
    %   selector = IterationCountTimeStepSelector();
    %   selector = IterationCountTimeStepSelector('targetIterationCount', 5);
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   Routine used for dynamic timestepping 
    %
    % REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
    %   None.
    %
    % OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
    %   targetIterationCount  - Desired number of iterations.
    %
    %   iterationOffset       - Uses [actual + iterationOffset] to calculate
    %                           the parameter. Larger values makes the step
    %                           selector less aggressive for iteration targets
    %                           near zero.
    %
    %   (Other options)       - Inherited from SimpleTimeStepSelector.
    %
    % RETURNS:
    %   Time step selector.
    %
    %
    % SEE ALSO:
    %   SimpleTimeStepSelector, NonLinearSolver

    properties
        targetIterationCount % Desired number of nonlinear iterations per timestep.
        iterationOffset % Offset to make iteration a bit smoother as a response function.
