function map = cartBlockMap(G, rock, partition, varargin)
% Find identical coarse blocks in a partition of a Cartesian grid. This
% function returns a map, which split all coarse cells into max(map) number
% of groups. All coarse cell j with map(j)==i are in group i, and are
% considered identical, i.e. they share the exact same properties and are
% equivalent wrt. upscaling.

% Methodology: we start with all coarse cells in the same group (group 1).
% Then we split cells into a new group if these cell do not match the other
% cells in the same group. We check for one property at a time. We will end
% up with max(map) number of groups, where all coarse cells in the same
% group share the exact same properties.
