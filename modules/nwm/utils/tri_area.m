function area = tri_area(P1, P2, P3)
% A Copy from 'hfm' module
% tri_area(P1, P2, P3) calculates the triangle area given the coordinates
% of its vertices in P1, P2 and P3 using Heron's formula.
% Heron's Formula:
% s = semiperimeter
% A = sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))
% Where a,b,c are lengths of the triangle edges

    diff1 = P1 - P2;
    diff2 = P1 - P3;
    diff3 = P3 - P2;
    a = norm(diff1);
    b = norm(diff2);
    c = norm(diff3);

    % sort the elements
    v = sort([a b c]);
    a = v(3);
    b = v(2);
    c = v(1);

    temp = b + c;
    v1 = a + temp; % 2s
    temp = a - b;
    v2 = c - temp; % 2*(s-a)
    v3 = c + temp; % 2*(s-b)
    temp = b - c;
    v4 = a + temp; % 2*(s-c)
    area = 0.25 * sqrt(abs(v1*v2*v3*v4));
