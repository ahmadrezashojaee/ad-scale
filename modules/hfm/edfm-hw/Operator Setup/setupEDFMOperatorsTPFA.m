% Modified from setupOperatorsTPFA.m. Additional lines are added to include
% non-neighbouring connections. Do not use the optional parameters when
% using this function. See Lines 109 and 133.

% Set up helper structure for solvers based on automatic differentiation.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   s = setupOperatorsTPFA(G, rock)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The automatic differention solvers rely on discrete operators for
%   divergence and gradient on the grid as well as a variety of derived
%   reservoir quantities such as transmissibility and pore volume. The
%   purpose of this function is to assemble all such quantities using a
%   standard two-point finite volume approxiation (TPFA).
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%
%   G       - MRST grid given as a struct. See grid_structure.m for more
%             details.
%
%   rock    - Rock structure containing fields .perm and .poro with
%             approprioate dimensions for the grid. See makeRock for more
%             details.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS (supplied in 'key'/value pairs ('pn'/pv ...)):
%
%   'deck'      - deck file containing rock properties
%
%   'trans'     - transmissibility for internal faces (if neighbors given) or for all faces (if
%                 neighbors are not given)
%
%   'neighbors' - neighbors for each internal face
%
%   'porv'      - pore volumes for all cells
% RETURNS:
%   s           - Operators struct, with discrete operators and derived
%                 quantities:
%         T_all:  Transmissibilities for all interfaces, *including*
%                 (half) transmissibilities for faces on the boundary. One
%                 value per interface.
%
%         T    : Transmissibilities for all internal interfaces. Internal
%                interfaces have a cell on both sides.
%
%         pv   : Pore volumes. See function poreVolume. One value per cell.
%
%         C    : Transfer matrix between cells and faces. Used to derive
%                discrete gradient and divergence operators.
%
%      faceAvg : (Function) For each interface, computes the average value
%      of a quantity defined in the cells. If a face is connecting cells 4
%      and 5, the faceAvg function will compute the arithmetic average of
%      the values in both cells.
%
%      Grad    : (Function)  Discrete gradient. Computes the gradient on
%      each interface via a first order finite difference approximation
%      using the values of the cells connected to the face.  
%                
%      Div     : (Function) Discrete divergence. Integrates / sums up
%      values on the interfaces for all cells to give the (integrated)
%      divergence per cell.
%
%      faceUpstr: (Function) Perform upstream weighting of values. Given a
%      set of cell wise values and a upstream flag for each interface, this
%      function will pick the values corresponding to the position in the
%      neighborship. I.e. if the flag is true for a given interface, it
%      will select the value in the FIRST cell connected to the interface
%      x(N(faceNo, 1)). Otherwise, it will select the SECOND x(N(faceNo,
%      2)). Typical usage is for upstream weighting of transported
%      quantities.
%
%      N      : Neighborship structure. Will be number of interfaces by 2
%               in size where N(ix, :) contains the cells connected to
%               face number ix.
