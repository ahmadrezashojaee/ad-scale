function [lambda, mu] = ENu2LMu_3D(E, nu)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [lambda, mu] = ENu2LMu_3D(E, nu)
%
% DESCRIPTION: Compute the Lamé parameters lambda and mu in the 2D case
% from the Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio Nu. In the orthogonal
% direction (with respect to the 2D plane), it is assumed zero
% displacement. In particular, it implies that Nu = 0.5 corresponds as in
% the 3D case to an incompressible material. An other assumption, which is
% not used here, could be that there is no stress in the orthogonal
% direction.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   E  - Young's modulus
%   nu - Poisson's ratio
%
% RETURNS:
%   lambda - First Lamé coefficient
%   mu     - Second Lamé coefficient
