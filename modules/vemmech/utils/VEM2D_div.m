function [div] = VEM2D_div(G, varargin)
% Discrete divergence operator for the virtual element method in 2D
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [div] = VEM2D_div(G)
%
% DESCRIPTION: Computes a discrete divergence operator in 2D. This discrete div operator is a mapping from node-valued
% displacement vector to cell-valued 2D vector. Node-valued displacement vectors correspond to the degrees of freedom that
% determine for each cell a displacement function over the cell via the virtual basis function. The discrete divergence
% operator that is assembled here computes the divergence of the L^2 projection, cell-wise, of this displacement
% function. For more detail, see paper [Andersen et al: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09508v1].
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G - Grid structure
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   'extraFaceDof' - This option has to be set to get a stable divergence
%                    operator when extra degrees of freedom have been introduced
%                    on the edges to avoid numerical locking.
% RETURNS:
%   div - matrix corresponding to the discrete divergence operator.
