function D = C2D(C, G,varargin)
% Compute the matrix of normalized strain energies (D) from the elasticity
% tensor (C) associated with grid (G).
%
% convert Stiffness tensor from Voigt notation to plain notations (no
% factors are applied to the off-diagonal coefficients of the strain
% tensor). The latter is used in our formulation of VEM. The resulting tensor
% D is such that, for S in plain notation, we have: S'DS = energy.
