* Do not compute twice facets and g
* Uniformize interface of computeFacetNormals and computeNodeFaceCentroids
* The option bcetazero is not used in the computation of the coupling terms 
* Check bcetazero in runBiotSim
* rho is not volumetric
* In bc for mpsa, rename bc with bcdir?
* Switch to neumann also in flow part in runBiot convergence test
* Changed name from runBiotSim to runBiotConvSim (for consistency)
* Comment on fact that Neumann Biot is special
* Check bcetazero for biot.
  What do we use? is it consistent between mpsa and mpfa?
* Switch to getDispatchInd in blockAssembleMPSA
* Use computeConsistentGradient in blockAssemblyMPSA
* Add switch for setupStandardTbls (mpfa or mpsa alone)
* Document divoperator and computenodedisp in utils
* Implement divergence operator for blockMPSA
* In Tensor Assembly, add check when a matrix in matlab format only is multiplied with a matrix in SparseTensor format only.
  - seems to go wrong (get zero matrix)
* In AD code, include setting of continuity point
  - parameter eta
  - also bcetazero
* In AD code, include nonisotropic perm in mpfa
* in AD code for fluid, recover directly pv (without calling tpfa)
* In setupMpfaOperators, call useVirtual
* Add normalization of D for mpfa also in blockMPSAAssembly
* Assemble stress operator once for all (not each time it is called)
* R1 and R2 not used any more in assembleMPSA?
* Comment that computing facenodedisp to get div (for example) is not efficient
* Change in property functions assignment through setupStateFunctionGroupings requires validateModel
* Remove setupfacebc from assembly
* clean-up useVirtual and doptimize logic
* improve calls including nnodesperface/cell
