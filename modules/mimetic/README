Implementation of mimetic finite volume methods for incompressible (Poisson-type) pressure equations. Mimetic finite differences is a class of consistent discretizations that produce cellwise conservative velocity fields. These solvers support the same types of boundary conditions and wells as the incomp module does and can easily be used with the transport solvers contained therein (implicitTransport, explicitTransport).
