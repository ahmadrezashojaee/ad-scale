function x = mldivide_update(A, b, x_old, targets, complist)
% A,b linear system
% A_old, b_old old linear system
% x_old old solution vector
% targets, list of cells which should be updated (linear subsystems
% containing one of these cells must be updated)
% complist as defined by components(A)
% A should have the same graph, but not the same values as A_old
