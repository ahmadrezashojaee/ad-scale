% Create coarse dual partition/grid
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    Create coarse dual partition/grid using logical partitioning
% DESCRIPTION:
%
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%    CG -- Coarse grid as defined by partitionUI
%    blockSizes -- block sizes for partitionUI
% RETURNS:
%    dual -- Categorization of the nodes
% NOTE:
%    Use dualPartition for non-Cartesian grids or grids with erosion
