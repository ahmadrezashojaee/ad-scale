function [CG dual] = createPermutationMatrix(A, dual, CG, varargin)
% Create permutation matrices for the coarse orderings in the MsFV
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    Creates permutation matrices
% DESCRIPTION:
%    The MsFV is dependent on reordering the system matrices. This takes a
%    dual grid and coarse grid and uses them to create permutation matrices
%    for both primal and inner, edge... orderings
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%    A    -- Not in use
%    dual -- Dual coarse grid such as defined by dualPartition
%    CG   -- Coarse grid as defined by for example partitionUI
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%    wells   -- well data structure
%    SpeedUp -- Alternate formulation of the method requires alternate ordering matrices
%
% RETURNS:
%    CG   -- Coarse grid with updated partition structure to account for
%    wells
%    dual -- Updated dual grid with permutation matrices
% NOTE:
%    This function is meant for encapsulation within the MSFVM solver, and
%    is subject to change
