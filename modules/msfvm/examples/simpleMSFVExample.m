%% Multiscale Finite Volume Pressure Solver
% This example compares the multiscale finite volume method with a fine scale
% solution for a simple case of single phase incompressible flow with wells
% and boundary conditions on a Cartesian grid.
%
% The Multiscale Finite Volume Method (MsFVM) is a multiscale method where
% instead of solving a full discretization for all fine cells, a series of
% smaller, local problems are solved with unit pressure to give a coarse
% pressure system. The resulting coarse pressure is then used to scale the
% local problems to find a fine scale pressure approximation.
%
% The method is attractive because pressure updates are inexpensive once
% the pressure basis functions have been constructed and because it
% guarantees a conservative flow field if an additional set of basis
% functions are created.

%% Load the modules required for the example
% We will use streamlines and coarse grids.

%% We define a simple 2D Cartesian grid
% The fine scale grid will consist of $50\times50$ fine cells, with a
% coarse grid of $3\times3$ coarse blocks.
nx = 50; ny = 50;

Nx = 3; Ny = 3;

% Instansiate the fine grid
G = cartGrid([nx, ny]);
G = computeGeometry(G);

% Generate coarse grid
p = partitionUI(G, [Nx, Ny]);
CG = generateCoarseGrid(G, p);
CG = coarsenGeometry(CG);
%% Generate dual grid from the coarse grid using a logical algorithm
% The dual grid is based on the coarse grid and has corners defined by the
% coarse centroids of the coarse grid. Here our grid is Cartesian which
% makes it easy to define a dual grid based on the logical indices.
%
% We also visualize the dual grid. Cells corresponding to primal coarse
% centers are drawn in green, edge cells are drawn in orange and the primal
% coarse grid is drawn in red. Note that while the coarse grid is face
% centered, the dual coarse grid is cell centered, giving overlap between
% edges.

%% Set up permeability and fluid
% We create a fluid object for one phase flow. The permeability is
% generated via a porosity distribution, which is then visualized.

% effect on the solver.

%% Solve the systems.
% First we initiate a pressure system. This structure is always required,
% but without transport only the grid is relevant.
%
% We also compute transmissibilities. The MS solver is based on the TPFA
% solver, and as such has many of the same arguments. Multiscale methods in
% general can be seen as approximations to a specific discretization, and
% will inherit any strengths and weaknesses from the parent method, for
% instance grid orientation effects.
%
% The system is then solved three times: Once with a full TPFA solver, once
% with the multiscale sovler with conservative flow and lastly using the
% multiscale solver without conservative flow.

sol = initState(G, [], 0, 1);

T = computeTrans(G, rock);

% Solve TPFA reference solution.

%% Decompose the solution
% We observe that the error is large near the wells. This is not a
% coincidence: The MsFV solves bases its initial pressure solution of a
% coarse system, which does not actually include wells other than in a
% integral sense. We can decompose the solution to see this:

% Find the pressure basis
p_basis = solMSFV.msfvm.B*solMSFV.pressurecoarse;
p_corr = solMSFV.msfvm.Cr;
P = solMSFV.P';
% We need to permute this back to the original grid ordering using the
% permutation matrix...
p_basis = P*p_basis;
p_corr  = P*p_corr;

%% Plot the basis solution
% Note that the pressure has become low where the wells are! This happens
% because the system simultanously tries to create correct flux over the
% edges of the coarse grid as if the wells were there, but tries to find a
% pressure solution where the wells are not actually included. This leads
% to low pressure. However, a set of correction functions are constructed,
% which add inn fine scale behavior of the wells as well as boundary
% conditions:

clf;
plotCellData(G, p_basis)
title('Basis pressure');
outlineCoarseGrid(G,p, 'red')
plotDual(G, DG)

%% Plot the correction functions
% The actual pressure is the sum of these two solutions. Note that when
% applied as an iterative method, the correction functions also contain
% non-local effects, i.e. source terms trying to minimze the residual.

clf;
plotCellData(G, p_corr)

%% Plot streamlines for the reference
[i j] = ind2sub(G.cartDims, 1:G.cells.num);
% Start a streamline at all the boundaries, as well as in each well.
startpts = find(i == max(i) | i == min(i) | j == min(j) | j == max(j));
startpts = [startpts'; vertcat(W.cells)];

% Once a flux is plotted, reverse the flux to get more streamlines.
