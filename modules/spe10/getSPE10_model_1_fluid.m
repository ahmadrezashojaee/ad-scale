function fluid = getSPE10_model_1_fluid()
%Construct ADI Fluid Object for Model 1 of Tenth SPE CSP
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   fluid = getSPE10_model_1_fluid
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   None.
%
% RETURNS:
%   fluid - Simplified ADI fluid object, suitable for use with simulator
%           function simulateScheduleAD, that represents the petrochemical
%           properties of the fluids in Model 1 of the Tenth SPE CSP.  The
%           fluids are immiscible and incompressible with constant
%           viscosities, but there is a non-trivial relative permeability
%           relation between the oil and gas phases.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `getSPE10_model_1_relperm`, `initSimpleADIFluid`, `initDeckADIFluid`.

   % The fluids in this simulation model are incompressible and immiscible
   % with constant viscosities.  This means we can use MRST's special
   % purpose fluid constructor |initSimpleADIFluid| to create the fluid
   % object.  We will however need to use sampled relative permeability
   % curves so we do not enter any relative permeability data in this call.

   % Replace the synthetic relative permeability curves created through
   % function |initSimpleADIFluid| with the real benchmark values.
