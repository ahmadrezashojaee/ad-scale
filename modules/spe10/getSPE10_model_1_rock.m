function rock = getSPE10_model_1_rock()
%Define rock properties for Model 1 of tenth SPE CSP
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   rock = getSPE10_model_1_rock
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   None.
%
% RETURNS:
%   rock - Rock structure having fields 'perm' and 'poro' for the entire
%          100-by-1-by-20 cell geometry of the first benchmark dataset of
%          the tenth SPE comparative solution project.  The permeability
%          distribution is a correlated geostatistically generated field
%          whereas the porosity is homogenous (phi=0.2) throughout the
%          formation.
%
% NOTE:
%   The permeability data is returned in strict SI units (metres squared).
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `getSPE10rock`, `make_spe10_data`.
