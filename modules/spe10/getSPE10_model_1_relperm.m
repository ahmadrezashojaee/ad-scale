function kr_deck = getSPE10_model_1_relperm()
%Define Oil/Gas Relative Permeability Properties for Model 1 of tenth SPE CSP
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   kr_deck = getSPE10_model_1_relperm
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   None.
%
% RETURNS:
%   kr_deck - Stripped-down simulation deck for ADI-fluid (relperm)
%             construction.  This input-deck contains just enough basic
%             information to form relative permeability curves from the CSP
%             benchmark data through the use of module 'ad-props's function
%             initDeckADIFluid.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `getSPE10_model_1_rock`, `initDeckADIFluid`.
