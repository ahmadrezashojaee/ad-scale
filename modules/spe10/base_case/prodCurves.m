function [vpt, opr, wpr, wc] = prodCurves(w, state, fluid)
%Calculate derived production data for wells.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [tot, opr, wpr, wc] = prodCurves(W, state, fluid)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   W     - Well data structure as defined by function addWell.
%
%   state - Solution state object as defined by functions 'initResSol',
%           'initWellSol' and, possibly, flow and/or transport solvers.
%
%   fluid - Fluid data structure.
%
% RETURNS:
%   tot - Total well production.  One value for each individual well.
%
%   opr - Oil (liquid) production rate.  One value for each individual well.
%
%   wpr - Water production rate.  One value for each individual well.
%
%   wc  - Water cut.  One value for each individual well.
%
% LIMITATION:
%   This function assumes that the solution state object represents
%   incompressible two-phase flow.
