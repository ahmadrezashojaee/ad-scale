function [categories, c_h, colNo] = findCategoriesMultiVE(G, trans)
%Classify cells according to VE region
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [categories, c_h, colNo] = findCategoriesMultiVE(G, trans)
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G     - Grid structure.
%
%   trans - Transmissibility. Only zero/non-zero information is used.
%
% RETURNS:
%   categories - Classification of each cell in the fine grid into VE
%                regions, where the same region indicator for a pair of
%                cells mean that they belong to the same horizontal flow
%                region where (potentially) VE can be valid
%
%   c_h        - Indicator of which column subset each entry belongs to. A
%                column may be split into multiple parts if the
%                transmissibility is zero, or geometry connectivity is
%                missing.
%
%   colNo      - Column number of each cell (uses IJK indexing, no account
%                for disconnected layers etc)
