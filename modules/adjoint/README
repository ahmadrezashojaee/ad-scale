Implements strategies for production optimisation based on adjoint formulations. This enables for, instance, optimization of net present value constrained by the bottom-hole pressure in wells. This module is limited to two-phase, incompressible flow as implemented in the incomp module. For optimization problems with more complex fluid physics, the newer "optimization" module is recommended.
