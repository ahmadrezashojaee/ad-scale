function b = computeAdjointRHS(G, W, f_res)
% Compute adjoint 'pressure' rhs
% for use in e.g. function solveAdjointPressureSystem
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   b = computeAdjoint(G, W, f_res, f_w)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Computes adjoint 'pressure' rhs as input to solveIncompFlow
% in function solveAdjointPressureSystem
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G     - Grid data structure.
%
%   W     - Well structure as defined by addWell &c.
%
%   f_res - Adjoint reservoir 'pressure' condtions
%
% RETURNS:
%   b     - Ajoint pressure rhs to be passed directly as option
%           'rhs' to solveIncompFlow.
