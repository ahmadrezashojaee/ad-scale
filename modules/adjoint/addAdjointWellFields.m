function W = addAdjointWellFields(CG, W, varargin)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   W = addAdjointWellFields(CG, W, varargin)
%   W = addAdjointWellFields(CG, W, 'OverlapWell', 0, 'OverlapBlock', 4);
%
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%  Hack for the adjoint code:
%  Add additional fields to the Well-structure.
%  The added fields are coarseCells and optionally CS.overlap and
%  CS.wellOverlap.
%
%  Needed in updateWells and createSingleCellPseudoWells.
