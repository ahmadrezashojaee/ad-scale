function state = computeInitDisp(model, state, uu, varargin)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function state = computeInitDisp(model, state, uu, varargin)
%
% DESCRIPTION: Compute the initial displacement
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   model    - Model that contains a mechanical model (model.mechModel)
%   state    - Initial state, to be modified
%   uu       - Given initial displacement, if the initial state is not
%              computed by solving the mechanical system
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%  'pressure' - fluid pressure. Used as input for mechanical system.
%
% RETURNS:
%   state - State updated with computed mechanical variables.
