function p = compressPartition(p)
%Renumber coarse block partitioning to remove any empty coarse blocks.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = compressPartition(p)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p - Original partition vector, may contain empty coarse blocks.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p - Updated partition vector.
%       Renumbered so as to remove empty coarse blocks.
%
% NOTE:
%   If the original partition does not contain any empty coarse blocks,
%   applying this function is an expensive way of doing nothing.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   p = partitionCartGrid([4, 4, 1], [2, 2, 2]);
%   [p, compressPartition(p)]
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `partitionCartGrid`, `partitionUI`, `processPartition`, `generateCoarseGrid`.
