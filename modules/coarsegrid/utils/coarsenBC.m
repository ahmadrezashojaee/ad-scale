function bc = coarsenBC(cg, bc)
%Construct coarse-grid boundary conditions from fine-grid boundary cond.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   bc = coarsenBC(cg, bc)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   All 'pressure' boundary conditions are mapped from fine-grid to the
%   coarse-grid faces by sampling the value at cg.faces.centerFace *). All
%   flux boundaries are accumulated
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   cg      - Coarse-grid including parent grid.
%
%   bc      - MRST boundary conditions struct as returned by addBC.
%
% RETURNS:
%   bc      - MRST boundary conditions for coarse-grid cg.  For 'pressure'
%             conditions, the value is sampled in cg.faces.centerFace.  For
%             'flux' conditions, the nex flux accoss the coarse face is
%             computed.  Mixed conditions are not supported.
