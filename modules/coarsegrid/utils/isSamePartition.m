function b = isSamePartition(p1, p2)
%Check if two partition vectors represent the same grid partition
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   b = isSamePartition(p1, p2)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p1, p2 - Partition vectors.
%
% RETURNS:
%   b - Whether or not partitions p1 and p2 are exactly equal or, failing
%       that, whether or not one is a renumbering/permutation of the other.
%       Logical scalar.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function uses sortrows in all but the most trivial cases.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   p1 = partitionCartGrid([9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3]);
%   i  = randperm(max(p1));
%   p2 = 10 * i(p1);              % Note: Holes in partition vector.
%   b  = isSamePartition(p1, p2)
