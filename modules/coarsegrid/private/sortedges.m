function [map, sign, success] = sortedges(edges, pos)
% SORTEDGES(E, POS) sorts the edges given by rows in E.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [map, sign, success] = sortedges(e, pos)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   edges   - An n-by-2 array of edges given by pairs of node numbers; one edge
%             per row.
%
%   pos     - Row positions in e, marking the beginning of each section in e to
%             be sorted separately.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   map    - Row permutation of edges such that edge edge(j(i),:) is
%            followed by edge edges(j(i+1),:).
%
%   sign   - Sign of each edge, i.e., if E=edge(j,:), then
%            "E(s<0,:)=E(s<0,[2,1]);" renders E fully sorted such that
%            E(k, 2) == E(k+1, 1) within each section.
%
%   success - #sections-by-1 logical array indicating which sections have
%             been sorted successfully.
%
% NOTE:
%    1) This is the Pure Matlab Version.
%
%    2) The sequence of edges in each section must form a one-dimensional
%       connencted graph, that may form a closed loop or not.   Branches
%       are considered an input error.
%
%       If branches, i.e., nodes with more than two edges or disconnected
%       edge sets are encountered, a warning message is issued. Such edges
%       do not have a well-defined order.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%
%   p     = [1;4;6];
%   e     = [2,3; 2,1; 3,1; 1,3; 2,3];
%   [m,s] = sortedges(e, p);
%   E     = e(sub2ind(size(e), [m,m], [1-min(s,0), 1+max(0,s)]));
