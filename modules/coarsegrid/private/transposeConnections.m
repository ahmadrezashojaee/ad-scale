function [connPos, conns] = transposeConnections(N)
%Derive block->connection (face) mapping from connection->block mapping
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [connPos, conns] = transposeConnections(N)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   N - Neighbourship definition.  An m-by-2 array representing connections
%       between entities.  May be a (coarse-scale) equivalent of the
%       faces.neighbors fields in the MRST grid structure.
%
% RETURNS:
%   connPos - 
%       Indirection array into the 'conns' array of block->connection
%       mappings.  Specifically, the connections of block 'i' are located
%       in elements
%
%              connPos(i) : connPos(i + 1) - 1
%
%       of the 'conns' array.
%
%   conns - 
%       Connection data ordered per block.
%
% NOTE:
%   If the connection/neighbourship definition 'N' indeed is the
%   faces.neighbors field of a grid_structure, then the (connPos,conns)
%   packed data array pair corresponds to (a possibly permuted version of)
%   the (cells.facePos,cells.faces) packed data array pair of the same grid
%   structure.
%
%   This function uses SORTROWS.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `coarseConnections`, `sortrows`, `grid_structure`.
