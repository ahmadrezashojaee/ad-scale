function [conn, ind, cpos, fconn] = coarseConnections(G, p, varargin)
%Derive connection/topology structure on coarse grid
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    conn                    = coarseConnections(G, p)
%    conn                    = coarseConnections(G, p, Ic)
%   [conn, ind, cpos, fconn] = coarseConnections(...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - Fine-scale grid structure over which to derive coarse topology.
%
%   p  - Partition vector for fine-scale entities (cells).
%
%   Ic - Discrete indicator function.  An m-by-n numeric array of function
%        values.  There must be one row in 'Ic' for each connection (row)
%        in the neighbourship definition. In other words, if we set
%        N=G.faces.neighbors, then m==SIZE(N,1). 
%        OPTIONAL.  Default value: Ic = ONES([m, 1]).
%
% RETURNS:
%   conn - 
%        Coarse-scale connection structure represented as a neighbourship
%        definition (m-by-2 array of coarse-scale block pairs).  If we set
%        q = [0; p], then the coarse-scale connection is defined as the
%        intersection of the unique block pairs defined by q(N+1) with the
%        corresponding unique applicable indicator tuples defined by Ic.
%
%   ind - 
%        Actual indicator value (including half-face tag if present)
%        associated with each coarse-scale connection.
%
%   cpos, fconn -
%        Packed data-array representation of coarse->fine connection
%        mapping.  Specifically, the elements
%
%              fconn(cpos(i) : cpos(i + 1) - 1)
%
%        are the fine-scale connections (i.e., rows of the neighbourship
%        definition N) that constitute coarse-scale connection i.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function uses SORTROWS.
