function pf = cellPartitionToFacePartition(g, p, varargin)
%Construct partition of all grid faces from cell partition.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   pf = cellPartitionToFacePartition(g, p)
%   pf = cellPartitionToFacePartition(g, p, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Define unique partition ID for each pair of cell partition IDs
%   occurring in a partition vector, and construct a partitioning of all
%   faces in a grid.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   g       - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
%   p       - Cell partition
%
%   'pn'/pv - List of 'key'/value pairs for supplying optional parameters.
%             The supported options are
%                AllBoundaryFaces -
%                  Flag indicating whether or not every fine-scale boundary
%                  face should be assigned a separate, unique partition ID
%                  number to force individual inclusion in the coarse grid.
%
%                  Logical.  Default value: AllBoundaryFaces=false (do not
%                  assign separate partition IDs to each fine-grid boundary
%                  face).
%
% RETURNS:
%   pf      - Face partition.  One non-negative integer per face in 'g'.
%             Fine-scale faces that are not on the boundary between coarse
%             blocks are assigned a partition ID number of zero.

%   `processFacePartition`
