%% Subdivision of Coarse Faces
% So far, we have assumed that there is only a single connection between
% two neighboring coarse blocks. This connection is built up of all faces
% between pairs of fine cells that belong to the two different coarse
% blocks. However, we can make coarse grids that have multiple connections
% between neighboring grid blocks, as the following examples shows.
G = computeGeometry(cartGrid([20 20 6]));
c = G.cells.centroids;
G = removeCells(G, (c(:,1)<10) & (c(:,2)<10) & (c(:,3)<3));

p = partitionUI(G,[2, 2, 2]); p = compressPartition(p); mp = max(p);
q = partitionUI(G,[4, 4, 2]);
CG = generateCoarseGrid(G, compressPartition(p), ...
                        cellPartitionToFacePartition(G,q));
clf
plotCellData(CG,(1:mp)');
plotFaces(CG,1:CG.faces.num,'FaceColor' , 'none' , 'LineWidth' ,2);

colormap(.5*(jet(128)+ones(128,3)));


%% Adding geometry information to the coarse grid
% Unlike the fine grids, the coarse grid structure only contains
% topological information by default. This means, in particular, that
% coarse grids do not have nodes. By calling coarsenGeometry, we can get
% coarse block and face centroids, volumes, and so on.
CG = coarsenGeometry(CG);

plotPts = @(pts, varargin) plot3(pts(:,1), pts(:,2), pts(:,3), varargin{:});
hold on
h=plotPts(CG.faces.centroids, 'k*');
hold off;

% Let us look more in detail on the relationship between centroids in the
% fine and coarse grid

% The coarse grid also contains lookup tables for mapping blocks and
% interfaces in the coarse grid to cells and faces in the fine grid. To
% demonstrate this, we visualize a single coarse face consisting of several
% fine faces along with the cells its block neighbors in red and blue
% respectively on the fine grid.
