function partition2 = processPartition(G, partition, facelist)
%Split disconnected coarse blocks into new blocks.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   q = processPartition(G, p)
%   q = processPartition(G, p, facelist)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G        - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
%   p        - Vector of size G.cells.num-by-1 of initial cell-to-block
%              mappings.  Assumed to be a vector of positive integers.  The
%              coarse block numbers are preserved for all blocks that are
%              internally connected.  Consequently, if all coarse blocks
%              are connected then ALL(q == p).
%
%   facelist - List of faces across which the connections between cells
%              should be removed before the processing
%
% RETURNS:
%   q        - Updated partition with only connected coarse blocks.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `processFacePartition`, `partitionUI`, `partitionCartGrid`.

   %  4) Assign new block numbers to the individual connected components
   %     found in step 3 while taking care to preserve the original block
   %     number of the first (and, possibly, only) block (i.e., component).
   %     This ensures that the output partition equals the input partition
   %     if no coarse blocks must be split.  As a special case, array
   %     'blkNo' must be empty when nbc==0 to avoid triggering an assertion
   %     in 'rldecode'.  This condition occurs if coarse block 'b' contains
   %     a single cell.

   blkNo            = [b, maxBlk + (1 : nComp - 1)];
