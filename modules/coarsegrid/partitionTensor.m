function p = partitionTensor(G, di, dj, dk)
%Partition Logically Cartesian Grid Into Tensor Product Blocks
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   % In two space dimensions
%   p = partitionTensor(G, di, dj)
%
%   % In three space dimensions
%   p = partitionTensor(G, di, dj, dk)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G          - MRST grid as described in grid_structure.  Assumed to
%                carry an underlying logically Cartesian structure (i.e.,
%                each cell can be identified by its (I,J) pair or (I,J,K)
%                triplet in two and three space dimensions, respectively.
%
%   di,dj,dk   - Tensor product block sizes.  Vectors of positive integers.
%                Specifically, the block at position (x,y,z) consists of
%
%                      di(x)-by-dj(y)-by-dk(z)
%
%                cells from the underlying fine-scale grid (i.e., G)--at
%                least if all cells are active.  These inputs play the same
%                roles, and are subject to the same restrictions like
%
%                      ALL([SUM(di), SUM(dj), SUM(dk)] == G.cartDims)
%
%                as the 'dimDist' inputs of function MAT2CELL.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p - Partition vector.  Contains no empty or multiply connected blocks.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `partitionUI`, `partitionLayers`, `mat2cell`.
