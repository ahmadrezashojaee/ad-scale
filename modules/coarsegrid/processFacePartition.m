function pf = processFacePartition(g, p, pf)
% Ensure that all coarse faces are connected collections of fine faces.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   pf = processFacepartition(g, p, pf)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   g  - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
%   p  - Partition vector of size [G.cells.num, 1] describing the coarse
%        grid.  We assume that all coarse blocks are connected.  The
%        partition vector is often created by function partitionCartGrid
%        or function partitionUI.
%
%   pf - Partition vector on faces of 'G'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   pf - Processed partition face vector.
%
% COMMENTS:
%   Currently only implemented for 2D grids.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `processPartition`, `cellPartitionToFacePartition`
