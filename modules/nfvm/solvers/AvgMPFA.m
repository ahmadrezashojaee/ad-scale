    properties

        % T is a cell structure containing two matrices which compute the fluxes. Each
        % matrix maps cell pressure values to internal face flux value. We have
        % one matrix for each side of the face (the first matrix for
        % G.faces.neighbors(: , 1) and the second for G.faces.neighbors(:, 2)).
