This package consists of the following files:

Main functions (in functions folder):
timeStepping.m : adaptive time stepping algorithm.	
newtonSolver.m : classical newton iterative solver which uses MRST's Automatic Differentiation.
arithmeticMPFA_hydHead.m : computes the arithmetic average of the intrinsic permeability.
upstreamMFA_hydHead.m : computes the upstream weighted average of the intrinsic permeability.

Example files (in examples folder):
waterInfiltration1D.m : one-dimensional water infiltration.
waterInfiltration3D.m : three-dimensional water infiltration in a heterogeneous domain.
waterEvaporation1D.m : instantaneous water evaporation in a homogeneous three-dimensional domain.
