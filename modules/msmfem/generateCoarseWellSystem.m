function W = generateCoarseWellSystem(G, S, CG, CS, mob, rock, W, varargin)
%Construct coarse system component matrices for well contributions.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   W = generateCoarseWellSystem(G, S, CG, CS, mob, rock, W)
%   W = generateCoarseWellSystem(G, S, CG, CS, mob, rock, W, ...
%                                'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - Grid data structure.
%
%   S       - System structure describing the underlying fine grid model,
%             particularly the individual cell flux inner products.
%
%   CG      - Coarse grid structure as defined by function
%             generateCoarseGrid.
%
%   CS      - Coarse system structure as defined by function
%             generateCoarseSystem.
%
%   mob     - Total mobility.  One scalar value for each cell in the
%             underlying (fine) model.
%
%   rock    - Rock data structure.  May be empty, but must contain valid
%             field 'rock.perm' if the synthetic driving source term for
%             basis functions is 'perm'.  Similarly, if the driving source
%             term is 'poros', then the rock data structure must contain a
%             valid field 'rock.poro'.
%
%   W       - Well structure as defined by function addWell.
%
%   'pn'/pv - List of 'key'/value pairs defining optional parameters.  The
%             supported options are:
%                - src -- Explicit source terms in the underlying fine grid
%                         model which must be taken into account when
%                         generating the basis functions.  Note that basis
%                         functions in blocks containing an explicit source
%                         term will be generated based solely on the
%                         explicit source.  The values in 'weight'
%                         pertaining to such blocks will be ignored.
%
%                         Must be a source data structure as defined by
%                         function 'addSource'.  Default value is [] (an
%                         empty array), meaning that no explicit sources
%                         are present in the model.
%
%                - OverlapWell --
%                         Number of fine grid cells by which to extend
%                         support of the well basis function about the well
%                         bore.
%
%                - OverlapBlock --
%                         Number of fine grid cells by which to extend
%                         support of the well basis function about the
%                         reservoir coarse block.
%
% RETURNS:
%   W - Updated well structure having new field W(i).CS defined as
%       W(i).CS.basis : Cell array of SPARSE input vectors from which well
%                       flux basis function matrix may be formed.
%       W(i).CS.basisP: Cell array of SPARSE input vectors from which well
%                       pressure basis function matrix may be formed.
%       W(i).CS.rates : Sparse matrix of well rates.
%
%       W(i).CS.C     :   | MS discretization matrices wrt activeFaces
%       W(i).CS.D     :  /
%
%       W(i).CS.RHS.f :   | Coarse well system right hand sides
%       W(i).CS.RHS.h :  /
