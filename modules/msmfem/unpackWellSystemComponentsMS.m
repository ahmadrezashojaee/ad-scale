function [B, C, D, f, h, Psi, Phi] = ...
      unpackWellSystemComponentsMS(W, G, p, mob, omega)
%Extract coarse linear system components from wells.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [B, C, D, f, h, ...
%    Psi, Phi] = unpackWellSystemComponentsMS(W, G, p, mob, rho)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function recovers contributions to the final, hybrid, system of
%   linear equations from which velocities and cell as well as contact
%   (face) pressures are determined.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   W   - Well structure as defined by functions addWell and
%         generateCoarseWellSystem.
%
%   G   - Underlying fine grid model of reservoir.
%
%   p   - Cell-to-block partition vector.
%
%   mob - Array, length n, of total mobility values.  One (positive) total
%         mobility value for each of the 'n' cells in the model.
%
%   rho - Array, length nf, of fluid densities.  One (positive) density
%         value for each fluid in the simulation model.  Only used in the
%         presence of gravity effects to add hydrostatic pressure
%         adjustments within the wells.
%
% RETURNS:
%   B   - Cell array, one entry for each well, of "mass matrices"
%         defined by well model productivity indices.
%
%   C   - Cell array, one entry for each well, of well discrete gradient
%         operators.
%
%   D   - Cell array, one entry for each well, of well flux continuitiy
%         matrices.
%
%   f   - Cell array, one entry for each well, of well target values.
%         Non-zero for pressure controlled (BHP) wells.  Zero otherwise.
%
%   h   - Cell array, one entry for each well, of well target values.
%         Non-zero for rate controlled wells.  Empty otherwise.
%
%   Psi - Well flux basis functions represented as a single sparse matrix
%         of size nfhf-by-(sum_w (numb of coarse blocks intersected by w)).
%         'nfhf' is the number of fine-scale half-faces.
%
%   Phi - Well pressure basis functions represented as a single sparse
%         matrix of size G.cells.num-by-(sum_w (above)).
%
% NOTE:
%   If the well structure is empty, i.e., if ISEMPTY(W), then all return
%   values, save 'Psi' and 'Phi', are CELL(1) (a one-element cell array
%   containing only an empty numeric array).  In this case 'Psi' and 'Phi'
%   are empty sparse matrices of the correct size (correct number of rows
%   and no columns).
