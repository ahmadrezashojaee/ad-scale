function A = msMatrixStructure(G, CG, varargin)
%Build synthetic matrix with same sparsity as hybrid coarse system matrix.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   A = msMatrixStructure(G, CG)
%   A = msMatrixStructure(G, CG, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - Grid data structure as described by 'grid_structure'.
%   CG      - Coarse grid data structure as defined by function
%             'generateCoarseGrid'.
%   'pn'/pv - List of 'key'/value pairs defining optional parameters.  The
%             supported options are:
%               - bc -- External boundary conditions.
%                       Must be a boundary condition data structure as
%                       defined by function 'addBC'.  Default value is []
%                       (an empty array), meaning that no boundary
%                       conditions are present in the model.
%
% RETURNS:
%   A - A synthetic matrix with the same sparsity structure as the coarse
%       hybrid system matrix derived in solver function
%       'solveIncompFlowMS'.  This matrix is mostly usable for passing
%       directly to sparsity inspection function 'spy'.  In particular, the
%       matrix 'A' does not have any of the analytic properties (e.g.,
%       eigenvalues) of the coarse hybrid system matrix.
%
% LIMITATION:
%   This function does not at present support well connections.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `generateCoarseSystem`, `solveIncompFlowMS`, `spy`.
