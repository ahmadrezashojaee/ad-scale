function CS = assignBasisFuncs(CS, V, P)
%Update reservoir coarse system basis functions following 'evalBasisFunc'.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   CS = assignBasisFuncs(CS, V, P)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   CS   - Original coarse system.  Must have allocated fields '.basis'
%          and '.basisP' of correct sizes.
%
%   V, P - New basis function values for flux (V) and pressure (P).
%          Assumed to be the return values from function 'evalBasisFunc'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   CS - Updated reservoir coarse system structure with new values for flux
%        and pressure basis functions.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `generateCoarseSystem`, `evalBasisFunc`.
