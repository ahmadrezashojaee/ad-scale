function p = splitBlocksForWells(p, splitFact, G, W)
%Split coarse blocks near wells.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = splitBlocksForWells(p, splitFact, G, W)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p         - Original partition vector
%
%   splitFact - Vector of coarse block splitting factors in each physical
%               direction.  Each block determined to be close to a well
%               will be split into PROD(splitFact) new coarse blocks.
%
%   G         - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
%   W         - Well structure defined by addWell &c.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p - Updated partition vector.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function potentially introduces a lot of new coarse blocks which
%   will impede execution speed if subsequently used to define a coarse
%   grid on which the multiscale pressure solver is employed.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `splitBlocks`, `refinePartitionForWells`.
