function checkBoundaryBasis(G, CG, CS, bc)
%Check structural integrity of coarse system versus boundary conditions.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   checkBoundaryBasis(G, CG, CS, bc)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G, CG - Grid and coarse grid, respectively.
%
%   CS    - Coarse-scale linear system structure as defined by function
%           'generateCoarseSystem'.
%
%   bc    - Boundary condition structure as defined by function 'addBC'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   Nothing.  However, a warning is printed if the set of boundary
%   conditions identified by 'bc' include external coarse boundaries for
%   which no basis functions have been computed.
%
% NOTE:
%   This is an internal function in the MsMFE implementation.  Its
%   existence, syntax and semantics may change without prior notice.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `solveIncompFlowMS`, `solveIncompFlowMSSpeedUp`.
