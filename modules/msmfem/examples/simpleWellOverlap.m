%% Multiscale Pressure Solver with Overlap:
% Use overlap in multiscale basis function to improve accuracy of the
% simulation.  We compare the fine-grid pressure solver and multiscale
% pressure solvers with and without overlap by solving the single-phase
% pressure equation
%
% $$\nabla\cdot v = q, \qquad v=\textbf{--}\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p,$$
%
% for a Cartesian grid with anisotropic, homogeneous permeability.
%
% This example shows the use of overlap around the well.

%% What is overlap?
% Overlap means that we extend the support of the multiscale basis
% functions, that is, we include more fine cells when computing the basis
% function. Using overlapping domains enables capturing more complex flow
% patterns, particularly for very coarse grids, at the expense of increased
% coupling in the resulting systems of linear equations. The use of overlap
% is particularly attractive in cases of highly heterogeneous reservoirs of
% cases where wells are placed near the corner of a coarse well-block. In
% the following, we describe the different types of overlap implemented in
% the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox. Let the thick lines be the
% coarse grid, the thin lines represent the fine grid, the shaded region
% the overlap (of fine cells), and the red circle be the well.
%
% Overlap in the reservoir basis function for a coarse face ij means that
% we include fine cells around the the neighboring coarse blocks when we
% compute the basis for face ij:
%
% <<basisIJ.png>>
%
% The flow near a well is described by a multiscale well basis. This
% basis normally only has support in the coarse well-block. If the well
% lies close to the corner of the well-block, this will be a poor
% description of the flow near the well because it will not describe the
% flow over the corner. In such cases we can use overlap around
% the well ('overlapWell'), here shown in different colors with increasing
% number of overlap:
%
% <<basisOverlapWell.png>>
%
% In some cases (e.g in case of highly hetereogeneous permeability) it
% might be necessary to use overlap around the entire well block
% ('OverlapBlock'):

%% Define and visualize the model
% We set up a simple 40-by-40-by-2 cartesian grid model with anisotropic,
% homogeneous permeability and assume that the reservoir is filled with a
% single fluid (with default values).
G         = cartGrid([40, 40, 2]);
G         = computeGeometry(G);
diag_k    = [500, 500, 50] .* milli*darcy;
rock.perm = repmat(diag_k, [G.cells.num, 1]);
fluid     = initSingleFluid('mu' ,    1*centi*poise     , ...
                            'rho', 1014*kilogram/meter^3);

% Set two vertical wells.
W = verticalWell([], G, rock,  8,  8, 1:G.cartDims(3), ...

%% Partition the grid and compute mimetic innerproduct
% We partition the fine grid uniformly into 5-by-5-by-1 blocks using no

%% Generate coarse well system with overlap around the well
% As can be seen from the plot of the model, the wells are near a corner of
% their supporting coarse blocks, which may lead to highly inaccurate
% results (as we will see shortly). To impreove the accuracy, we can
% introduce onverlap in the well basis functions. As pointed out above, we
% have two different choices: 'OverlapWell' and 'OverlapBlock'. The first
% includes cells around the well and the latter includes cells around the
% well-block (the coarse block containing the well). We apply overlap
% around the well for 'W1' and use no overlap for 'W' as a reference.
%
W1 = W;

% First no overlap
W  = generateCoarseWellSystem(G, S, CG, CS, mob, rock, W, ...
                              'OverlapWell',  0, 'OverlapBlock', 0);
% Then overlap around well
W1 = generateCoarseWellSystem(G, S, CG, CS, mob, rock, W1, ...
                              'OverlapWell', 10, 'OverlapBlock', 0);

%% Solve the global flow problems
%  The mass matrix B in the linear system will not be block-diagonal when
%  we use overlap. Thus, the lineary system system can not be reduced by
%  Schur-complement reduction as we do in the hybrid solver. Therefore, the
%  coarse system with overlap must be solved with option 'Solver', 'mixed'
%  as input to solveIncompFlowMS.

% Fine scale reference solution:
ref = initState(G, W, 0, 1);
ref = incompMimetic(ref, G, S, fluid, 'wells', W);

% Coarse scale - no overlap:
s = initState(G, W, 0, 1);
s = solveIncompFlowMS(s,  G, CG, part, S, CS, fluid, ...
                      'wells', W, 'Solver', 'mixed');

% Coarse scale - overlap:
s1 = initState(G, W, 0, 1);
s1 = solveIncompFlowMS(s1, G, CG, part, S, CS, fluid, ...
                       'wells', W1, 'Solver', 'mixed');
