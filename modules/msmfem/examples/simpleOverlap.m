%% Multiscale Pressure Solver with Overlap:
% Use overlap in multiscale basis function to improve accuracy of the
% simulation.  We compare the fine-grid pressure solver and multiscale
% pressure solvers with and without overlap by solving the single-phase
% pressure equation
%
% $$\nabla\cdot v = q, \qquad v=\textbf{--}\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p,$$
%
% for a Cartesian grid with anisotropic, homogeneous permeability.
%
% Overlap means that we extend the support of the multiscale basis
% functions, that is, we include more fine cells when computing the basis
% function. The use of overlap is particularly attractive in cases of
% highly heterogeneous reservoirs and wells that are placed near the corner
% of a coarse well-block. In the following, let the dashed lines be the
% coarse grid, the dotted lines represent the overlap, and let '*'
% represent a well.
%
%  Overlap in the reservoir basis function for a coarse face ij means that
% we include fine cells around the the neighboring coarse blocks when we
% compute the basis for face ij:

%                . o-----------------o .
%                  . . . . . . . . . .
%
%  The flow near a well is described by a multiscale well basis. This
% basis normally only has support in the coarse well-block. If the well
% lies close to the corner of the well-block, this will be a poor
% description of the flow near the well because it will not describe the
% flow over the corner. In such cases we can use overlap around
% the well ('overlapWell'):

%                      |        |
%                      o--------o
%
%  In some cases (e.g in case of highly hetereogeneous permeability) it
% might be necessary to use overlap around the entire well block
% ('OverlapBlock'):
%
%                    . . . . . . . .
%                    . o---------o .

%% Generate coarse well system with overlap around the well
% For overlap in the well basis we has two different choices: 'OverlapWell'
% and 'OverlapBlock'. The first includes cells around the well and the
% latter cells around the well-block (the coarse block containing the
% well). We apply overlap around the well for 'W1' and use no overlap for

%% Solve the global flow problems
%  The mass matrix B in the linear system will not be block-diagonal when
%  we use overlap. Thus, the lineary system system can not be reduced by
%  Schur-complement reduction as we do in the hybrid solver. Therefore, the
%  coarse system with overlap must be solved using option 'Solver', 'mixed'
%  as input to solveIncompFlowMS.
