function [CG, CS] = speedUpMS(G, CG, CS, type)
%Precompute MsMFE basis reduction matrices in order speed up assembly
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [CG, CS] = speedUpMS(G, CG, CS, solver)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G, CG  - Grid and coarse grid data structures respectively.
%
%   CS     - Coarse-scale linear system data structure as defined by
%
%   solver - Particular solver mode for which to precompute the basis
%            reduction matrices.  This mode defines the kind of system of
%            linear equations that will later be assembled and solved in
%            the 'solveIncompFlowMSSpeedUp' function.
%
%            String.  Must be one of 'hybrid' or 'string'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   CG, CS - Updated coarse-scale grid and linear system data structures
%            with additional fields designed to lower the cost of forming
%            the coarse-scale system of linear equations from which to
%            derive block fluxes and block pressures.
%
% NOTE:
%   If you wish to change the solver mode in function
%   'solveIncompFlowMSSpeedup', you must call 'speedUpMS' with a different
%   'solver' parameter.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `generateCoarseGrid`, `generateCoarseSystem`, `solveIncompFlowMSSpeedUp`.
