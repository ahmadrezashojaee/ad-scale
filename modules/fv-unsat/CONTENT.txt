This file briefly describes the content of the the fv-unsat module. Inside
the root folder, you will find the following folders:

* conv_tests,
* data,
* examples,
* models,
* utility.

In addition, this file (CONTENT.txt) a copy of the license (LICENSE.txt)
and the README (README.md).

The conv_tests folder contains two functions: convergenceRE.m (needed for 
the first numerical example) and convergenceUnsatBiot.m (needed for the 
second numerical example).

The data folder contains two .mat files (exacFormsRE.mat and 
exactFormsUnsatBiot.mat) and the function getHydraulicProperties.m. The 
.mat files contains the exact function handles neccesary for the 
convergence tests, and getHydraulicProperties.m is a mini-catalog of 
hydraulic properties.

The models folders contains the two parent classes for declaring the 
discrete models:

* modelRE.m (Richards' equation), and
* modelUnsatBiot.m (Equations of unsaturated poroelasticity).

The examples folder contains the examples that you will find in the chapter:

* convAnalysisRe.m (Example 1), 
* convAnalysisUnsatBiot.m (Example 2), 
* waterInfiltrationRE.m (Example 3), and
* desiccationUnsatBiot.m (Example 4).

Finally, in the utility folder, you will find the following utilitary
functions:

* arithmeticAverageMPFA.m,
* computeCriticalPressure.m,
* computeTopPressure.m,
* solverRE.m,
* solverUnsatBiot.m,
* timeStepping.m,
* upstreamWeightingMPFA.m,
* vGM_saturation.m,
* vGM_theta.m.
