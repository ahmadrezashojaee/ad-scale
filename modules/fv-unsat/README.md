# fv-unsat: An MRST module for unsaturated poroelasticity

## Description
This module implements a discretization of the (three-dimensional) equations of unsaturated poroelasticity using
cell-centered finite volume methods, specifically MPFA-O and MPSA-W. Note that if  mechanical effects are neglected, the set of equations reduce to the well-known Richards' equation. The module is written based on the Automatic Differentiation framework provided by MRST.

There are four numerical examples accompanying this module:
* convAnalysisRE.m
* convAnalysisUnsatBiot.m
* waterInfiltrationRE.m
* desiccationUnsatBiot.m

The first two are convergence tests and the last two are practical applications. Even though the numerical tests are well documented, they are not meant as tutorials, but rather included for demonstrative purposes. To learn the basics regarding the module usage, we recommend waterInfiltrationRE.m.

This module was largely based on:

## Requirements
* MRST (Tested version: 2019b)
* MATLAB (Tested version: R2019a)

## MRST dependencies
* [fvbiot](https://github.com/pmgbergen/fvbiot) (Please see Troubleshooting section below)
* [distmesh](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/)

## Troubleshooting
* If you are using an MRST version <= 2019b, you will have to clone the [fvbiot](https://github.com/pmgbergen/fvbiot) repository, and replace it manually in your MRST folder. Note that fvbiot is located inside the "modules" folder.
