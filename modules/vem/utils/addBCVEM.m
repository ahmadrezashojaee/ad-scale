function bc = addBCVEM(bc, f, t, g)
%Add boundary condition to (new or existing) BC using function handels,
%to be used in patch-testing and convergence tests in incompVEM.
%
% Syntax is similar to that of addBC, but with a function handle in stead
% of scalar value for each boundary. Each call to addBCVEM adds a set of
% faces with a given type and function handle bc.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   bc = addBC(bc, faces, type, function)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   bc       - Boundary condition structure from a prior call to 'addBCVEM'
%              which will be updated on output or an empty array (bc==[])
%              in which case a new boundary condition structure is created.
%
%   faces    - Global faces in external model for which this boundary
%              condition should be applied.
%
%   type     - Type of boundary condition. Supported values are 'pressure'
%              and 'flux', or cell array of such strings.
%
%   function - Boundary condition function. Interpreted as a pressure p
%              (in units of 'Pa') when type=='pressure' and as a
%              -K \nabla p \cdot n when type=='flux'. One scalar value for
%              each face in 'faces'.
%
%              Note: type=='flux' is only supported in 2D, and the function
%              is interpreted as K \nabla p \cdot n.
