function A = squeezeBlockDiag(A, n, r, c)
%Squeezes a block diagonal matrix in which each block has the same number
%of columns OR the same numer of rows.
%
%   The result is a 'column' or 'row' matrix:
%
%   [A     ]             [A]         [A     ]
%   [   B  ] -{column}-> [B]   and   [   B  ] -{row}-> [A  B  C]
%   [     C]             [C]         [     C]
%
%   SYNOPSIS:
%       A = squeezeBlockDiag(A, n, r, c)
%
%   REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%       A - Block diagonal matrix in which each block has the same number
%           of columns OR the same numer of rows.
%
%       n - Number of matrix blocks.
%
%       r - Number of rows in resulting matrix.
%
%       c - Number of columns in resulting matrix.
%
%   RETURNS:
%       A - Squeezed matrix.
