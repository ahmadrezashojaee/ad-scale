function [ix, varargout] = boxIndices
%Construct linear (cell) indices corrsponding to current input box
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   i     = boxIndices
%  [i, m] = boxIndices
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   None.
%
% RETURNS:
%   i - Linear (cell) indices corresponding to the current input box.
%
%   m - Maximum possible cell index in index set 'i'.  Corresponds to
%       PROD(defaultBox) and may exceed MAX(i) (but should never be less
%       than MAX(i)).
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `private/gridBox`, `private/defaultBox`.
