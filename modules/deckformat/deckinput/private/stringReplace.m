%Replace string within another
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   s = stringReplace(s1, s2, s3)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Replaces all occurrences of the string 's2' in string 's1' with the
%   string 's3'.  The new string is returned.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   s1 - Original input string.  May be a cell array of strings.
%
%   s2 - The string to replace.
%
%   s3 - Replacement string.
%
% RETURNS:
