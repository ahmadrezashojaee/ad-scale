function S = splitQuotedString(s)
%Separate a string with quoted substrings into constituent parts
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   S = splitQuotedString(s)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   s - Character array, possibly containing quoted substrings.
%
% RETURNS:
%   S - Scalar structure with the following fields
%         quoted   - Cell array of strings, each element of which
%                    corresponds to one quoted substring from 's'.
%                    Elements are ordered from left to right in order of
%                    appearance in 's'.
%
%         unquoted - Cell array of strings, each element of which
%                    corresponds to one unquoted substring from 's'.
%                    Elements are ordered from left to right in order of
%                    appearance in 's'.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   s = '1.0 1* ''H--'' Z -1.234e5 ''*PROD 1'' ''MULTX-''';
%   S = splitQuotedString(s);
%
%   assert (numel(S.unquoted) == 4)
%   assert (isequal(S.unquoted(1 : (end - 1)), ...
%                   { '1.0 1* ', ' Z -1.234e5 ', ' '}))
%
%   assert (isequal(S.quoted, { '''H--''', '''*PROD 1''', '''MULTX-'''}))
%
% NOTE:
%   If the input string 's' does not contain any quoted substrings, then
%   the entire string is returned in a single element of '.unquoted' and
%   the 'quoted' cell array is empty.
%
%   Use function private/assembleString to reassemble the input string 's'
%   from the return value 'S'.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `private/assembleString`.
