function s = assembleString(tokens)
%Assemble list of string tokens into single string
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   s = assembleString(tokens)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   tokens - Cell array of strings or return value from function
%            splitQuotedString.
%
% RETURNS:
%   s - Single character array derived from append each string token
%       sequentially from front to back.
%
% NOTE:
%   If the input is a cell array of strings, then the output is created by
%   separating each token by a single space character.  Otherwise, the
%   output is created by altering the unquouted tokens with the quoted
%   tokens.  No separator is inserted into the output string.
%
