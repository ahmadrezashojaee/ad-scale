function varargout = gridBox(varargin)
%Input box accessor function.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%       gridBox(b)
%   b = gridBox
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   b - Input box limits.  Must consist of exactly six (positive) integers
%       that define, respectively, lower and upper limits of the I, J, and
%       K axes of an ECLIPSE/FrontSim simulation model.
%
% RETURNS:
%   b - Current input box limits.
