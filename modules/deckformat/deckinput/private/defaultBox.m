function varargout = defaultBox(varargin)
%Default input box accessor function.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%       defaultBox(d)
%   b = defaultBox
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   d - Input box limits.  Must consist of exactly three (positive)
%       integers that define the default upper input box limits of the I,
%       J, and K axes of an ECLIPSE/FrontSim simulation model.  These
%       limits are assumed to correspond to the entire model and should
%       equal the data input in the 'DIMENS' keyword (i.e., the 'cartDims'
%       field of the MRST grid_structure.)
%
% RETURNS:
%   b - Default input box limits defined by [1, d(1), 1, d(2), 1, d(3)].
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `grid_structure`, `private/gridBox`.
