function tokens = tokenizeRecord(data)
%Split record into individual tokens while preserving quoted strings
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   tokens = tokenizeRecord(record)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   record - Character string, possibly containing quoted substrings.
%
% RETURNS:
%   tokens - Cell array of strings containing non-empty tokens from the
%            input record.  Quoted substrings are preserved as individual
%            tokens.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   record = '1.0 1* ''H--'' Z -1.234e5 ''*PROD 1'' ''MULTX-''';
%   tokens = tokenizeRecord(record);
%   expect = { '1.0', '1*', '''H--''', 'Z', '-1.234e5', ...
%              '''*PROD 1''', '''MULTX-''' };
%
%   assert (isequal(tokens, expect))
%

%   `private/splitString`, `private/removeQuotes`.
