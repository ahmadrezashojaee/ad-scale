function T = readImmisciblePVTTable(fid, ntab, ncol)
%Input immiscible ECLIPSE/FrontSim PVT table (e.g., PVDO, PVDG).
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   Table = readImmisciblePVTTable(fid, ntab, ncol)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   fid  - Valid file identifier (as obtained using FOPEN) to file
%          containing the PVT table.  FTELL(fid) is assumed to be at the
%          start of the PVT table (i.e., after the keyword, if any, which
%          prompted the reading of this table).
%
%   ntab - Number of PVT tables to input.  Typically corresponds to the
%          ECLIPSE/FrontSim parameter 'NTPVT' (item two of 'TABDIMS').
%
%   ncol - Number of columns in each of the 'ntab' tables.
%
% RETURNS:
%   Table - An ntab-by-1 cell array of immiscible PVT tables.  An
%           immiscible PVT table is an m-by-ncol array of type DOUBLE.  It
%           is the caller's responsibility to correctly interpret the
%           individual columns of a specific table.
%
% NOTE:
%   Immiscible PVT tables in ECLIPSE or FrontSim contain an arbitrary
%   number of records, each record separated by whitespace (typically
%   newline, '\n').  A table is terminated by a slash character ('/').
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `readRelPermTable`, `readMisciblePVTTable`.
