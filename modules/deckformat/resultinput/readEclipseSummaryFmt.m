function [smry, smspec] = readEclipseSummaryFmt(prefix)
%Read formatted (text/ASCII) ECLIPSE summary data
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [summary, smspec] = readEclipseSummaryFmt(prefix)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   prefix - Path-name prefix from which to construct list of summary file
%            names.  Specifically, this function reads files which match
%            the regular expressions
%
%                [prefix, '\.FSMSPEC']  (formatted summary specification)
%                [prefix, '\.A\d{4}']   (formatted summary files)
%
%            Use function 'readEclipseSummaryUnFmt' to read unformatted
%            (binary) summary data.
%
% RETURNS:
%   summary - Summary data structure.  All MINISTEP results of an ECLIPSE
%             run concatenated together.  Also includes an additional
%             sub-structure, UNITS, whose fields contain a textual
%             representation of unit of measurement of the corresponding
%             summary field such as
%
%                 summary.UNITS.TIME  = 'DAYS'
%                 summary.UNITS.WBHP  = 'BARSA'
%                 summary.UNITS.WOPR  = 'SM3/DAY'
%                 summary.UNITS.YEARS = 'YEARS'
%                 summary.UNITS.TCPU  = 'SECONDS'
%
%   smspec  - Summary specifiction obtained from the '.FSMSPEC' file.
%             Contains MINISTEP times and all summary vectors declared in
%             the run deck.  Additionally contains a field, '.RptTime' that
%             specifies the times at which restart files (3D data) is
%             reported.
