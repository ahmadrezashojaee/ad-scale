function output = readEclipseOutputFileFmt(fname)
%Read formatted (ASCII) ECLIPSE output/result file
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   output = readEclipseOutputFileFmt(filename)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   filename - Name (string) of text file containing formatted ECLIPSE
%              results (typically restart data, grid specification or
%              metadata on a particular result set).
%
%              The file represented by 'filename' will be opened using
%              function 'fopen' in mode 'rt'.
%
%              Use function 'readEclipseOutputFileUnFmt' to read
%              unformatted (binary) ECLIPSE-compatible results.
%
% RETURNS:
%   output   - Data structure containing all field data represented in the
%              input stream 'filename'.  One structure field for each data
%              field in the file.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `readEclipseOutputFileUnFmt`, `fopen`.
