function rstrt = readEclipseRestart(files, rstReader, opt)
%Read set of ECLIPSE restart files.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   restart = readEclipseRestart(files, rstReader, opt)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   files     - List, represented as a cell array of strings, of files from
%               which to extract restart data.
%
%   rstReader - Restart-file reader.  Assumed to support the syntax
%
%                   item = rstReader(filename)
%
%               whence the restart data contained in the resource (an
%               on-disk file) denoted by 'filename' will be read into a
%               structure ('item') whose fields correspond to the
%               individual restart data in the resource.
%
%               Typically corresponds to one of @readEclipseOutputFileFmt
%               or @readEclipseOutputFileUnFmt.
%
%   opt       - Subject to change.
%
% RETURNS:
%   restart - Restart data structure.  One field for each restart data item
%             in the set of restart files.  Individual restart data items
%             are stored in separate columns of the corresponding cell
%             array.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `private/readEclipseSummary`, `readEclipseOutputFileFmt`.
