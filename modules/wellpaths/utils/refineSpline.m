function [pts, v] = refineSpline(points, n_refine, interpType)
% Refine a curve to higher resolution using spline interpolation
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   pts = refineSpline(points, 10, 'spline');
%   pts = refineSpline(points, 5);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Refine a given curve given as a array of points into 
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   points     - A npts x dim array of points giving the curve to be
%                refined. Implicitly assumed to be ordered.
%
%   n_refine   - The refinement factor. If the original entries in points
%                contained n points, the output will have n_refine*n total
%                points.
%
%   interpType - Type of interpolation. Supports the same values as the
%                fourth argument to MATLABs interp1 function. If omitted,
%                it defaults to 'spline'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   pts        - Refined points.
%
%   v          - Parametrization of the new points. Continuous values from
%                1 to npts indicating how far along interpolated values are
%                on the original trajectory.
