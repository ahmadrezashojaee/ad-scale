function wellpath = combineWellPaths(wellpaths)
%Combine multiple simple paths into a full tree
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   wellpath = combineWellPaths({wp1, wp2, wp3});
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Given multiple simple well paths this function assembles a single well
%   tree from the inputs. For this to work we assume that:
%       - The paths are ordered by depth in the tree. This is not the
%       vertical depth, but rather that a path will always be connected to
%       one of the curves preceding it in the list.
%       - Paths (aside from the first one) always start with a point that
%       also exists in one of the preceding paths. This is used to connect
%       the paths.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%
%   wellpaths - Cell array of simple well paths to be assembled together. A
%               simple well path is assumed to contain a single list of
%               points (i.e. it will only represent a line segment).
%
% RETURNS:
%   wellpath  - Composite wellpath made from the simple wellpaths. The
%               topology will be tree-like in nature.
%
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `makeSingleWellpath`
