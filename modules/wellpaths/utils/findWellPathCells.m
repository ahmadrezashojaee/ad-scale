function [cells, segment, param, ptsind, DT] = findWellPathCells(G, wellpath, varargin)
%Convert well path to the intersected cells
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   cells = findWellPaths(G, wellpath);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   By creating a triangulation and mapping perforations to the closest
%   cells, this routine realizes the continuous well path into discrete
%   cells, making it possible to build simulation wells from it.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%  G        - The grid structure we want to realize the wells on.
%
%  wellpath - Well path. See "makeSingleWellpath" for spec.
%
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%  interpType - The type of interpolation used to extend the curve between
%               points. Supports the same types as MATLAB builtin interp1.
%               Default: Spline.
%
%  triangulation - The triangulation (typically from delaunayTriangulation)
%                  used to determine proximity in the grid.
%
%  refinement    - Refinement number used to further refine the well curve
%                  before computing which cells it intersect. Default: 100.
% RETURNS:
% 
%  cells      - The list of cells the well intersects. 
%
%  segment    - Segment indicator for each cell, indicating which wellpath
%               segment produced that specific completion. If multiple
%               choices are possible, the segment which comes first in
%               wellpath.points is used.
%
%  ptsind     - Point indicator, indicating which point in the segment was
%               the closest to a given cell. 
%
%  DT         - Triangulation used to produce the results.
%

% Intersect is the cells intersected by the well. Note that we use a
% logical map to ensure that segments that are further down the well will
% not be selected to fill a cell over a segment that is higher up.

% Segment will indicate for each perforated cell which well segment it

% fighting over control over cells, as the well cannot be perforated
