function [W, segInd, param] = getWellFromPath(W0, G, rock, wellpath, varargin)
% Convert well path to MRST well.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   W = getWellFromPath(W, G, rock, wellpath);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This routine converts a well path (representing curves and points) into
%   a well (represented by cells and connectivity). 
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   W0       - Well array to be extended with the new well.
%
%   G        - The grid the well is to be placed in.
%
%   rock     - Rock structure which defines permeability and porosity.
%
%   wellpath - Well path as procued by makeSingleWellPath or
%              combineWellPaths.
%
%  OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   
%   This function calls addWell. Any keyword arguments are
%   passed onto addWell.
%
% RETURNS:
%   W  - Updated wells
%
% NOTE:
%   Currently no special effort is made to ensure correct well indices for
%   the well.
