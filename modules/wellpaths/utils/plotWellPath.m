function h = plotWellPath(wellpaths, varargin)
%Plot a well path
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   plotWellPath(wellpath)
%   h = plotWellPath(wellpath, 'color', 'r')
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Plots a given well path, using colors and showing control points along
%   the curve.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%
%   wellpath - Well path to be plotted. See makeSingleWellpath.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   interpType  - Interpolation type used. Same possible values as for
%               MATLAB builtin interp1. Default: Spline. 
%
%   LineWidth   - Line width of curve used to draw wellpath segments.
%
%   MarkerColor - Used to colorize the control points.
%
%   Color       - Color of the line segments themselves.
% 
%   Refinement  - The path is refined using interpolation to produce nice
%                 curves. Entering a positive number here will refine the
%                 curve by a number of points. Interpreted as a
%                 multiplicative factor.
%
% RETURNS:
%   h           - Two-column array of handles. The first column contains
%               handles for the line segments and the second for the
%               control point markers.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `makeSingleWellpath`, `findWellPathCells`
