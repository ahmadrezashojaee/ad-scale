function sqform = convertAtlasToStruct(meta_thick, meta_top, data_thick, data_top)
%Create GRDECL struct from thickness/top data from the CO2 Storage Atlas 
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   grdecl = convertAtlasTo3D(m_thick, m_top, d_thick, d_top, 3)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Given two datasets with possibily non-matching nodes, interpolate and
%   combine to form a GRDECL struct suitable for 3D simulations after a
%   call to processGRDECL or for further manipulation.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   meta_thick - Metainformation for the thickness data as produced from
%                readAAIGrid
%
%   meta_top   - Metainformation for top data.
%
%   data_thick - Data for the thickness data as produced from
%                readAAIGrid
%
%   top_thick  - Data for the top data as produced from
%                readAAIGrid
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   sqform - GRDECL struct suitable for processGRDECL
%
%
% NOTES:
%       It is likely easier to use getAtlasGrid instead of calling this
%       routine directly.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `getAlasGrid`
