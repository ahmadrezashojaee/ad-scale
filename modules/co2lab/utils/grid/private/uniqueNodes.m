function [ncoords, ixs] = uniqueNodes(coords)
% Extract from the provided list of (non-unique) coordinates a unique set,
% and provide the corresponding indexing.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [ncoords, ixs] = uniqueNodes(coords)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   coords - N x D matrix of the D-dimensional coordinates for a set of
%            points.  Each row represents one point.
%
% RETURNS:
%   ncoords - M x D matrix of M points with unique nodes, resulting from
%             removing all duplicates from the 'coords' matrix.
%   ixs     - Indexing.  The point corresponding to row i in the original
%             'coords' matrix will find its coordinates at row ixs(i) in the
%             returned matrix 'ncoords'.
