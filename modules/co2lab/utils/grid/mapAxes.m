function mpos = mapAxes(pos, MA)
% Transform lateral position from map to local coordinate system 
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = mapAxis(pos, ma)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   pos - nx2 vector of map coordinates that are to be transformed
%
%   ma  - 6x1 vector of points: x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
%         Here: (x1,y1) describes a point on the y-axis, (x2,y2) is the
%         grid origin, and (x3,y3) is a point on the x-axis
%
% RETURNS:
%   p   - nx2 vector of coordinates transformed to local coordinate system
%   
% EXAMPLE:
%   p = mapAxes([x y], [100 100 0 100 100 0])
