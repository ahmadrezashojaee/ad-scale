function s = height2Sat(sol, Gt, fluid)
%Convert from height to saturation
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   s = height2Sat(sol, Gt, fluid)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   h - CO2 plume thickness.  One scalar value for each column in the
%       top-surface grid.
%
%       Values less than zero are treated as zero while values below the
%       bottom of a column are treated as the column depth.
%
%   Gt - A top-surface grid as defined by function 'topSurfaceGrid'.
%
%   fluid - a fluid object for example initiated with initVEFluid
%
% RETURNS:
%   s - Saturation - one value for each cell in the underlying 3D model.
%   Corresponds to state.s for the 3D problem.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `accumulateVertically`, `integrateVertically`
