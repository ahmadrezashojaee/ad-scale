function [f,df] = integrateVertically(fun, h, g)
%Compute integral of function, vertically per column.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   F = integrateVertically(f, h, G)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Computes a first order approximation to the integral
%
%        F(x,y) = \int_0^h f(x,y,z) dz
%
%   within each column of a top-surface grid.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   fun - Sampled values of function f(x,y,z).  One value for each cell in
%         the underlying three-dimensional model.
%
%   h   - Upper bound for the integral (*).  Typically corresponds to the
%         surface depth.  One scalar value for each column in the
%         top-surface grid.  As a special case a single, scalar value is
%         repeated for each column in the top-surface grid.
%
%   G   - A top-surface grid as defined by function 'topSurfaceGrid'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   F - Vertically averaged function value, F(x,y).  One scalar value for
%       each column in the top-surface grid 'G'.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `topSurfaceGrid`, `cumulativeHeight`.
