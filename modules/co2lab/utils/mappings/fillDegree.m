function [n, t] = fillDegree(h, G)
%Compute degree of fill (saturation).
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [n, t] = fillDegree(h, G)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   h - CO2 plume thickness.  One scalar value for each column in the
%       top-surface   grid.  As a special case a single, scalar value is
%       repeated for each column in the top-surface grid.
%
%       Values less than zero are treated as zero while values below the
%       bottom of a column are treated as the column depth.
%
%   G - A top-surface grid as defined by function 'topSurfaceGrid'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   n - Number of completely filled cells.  One non-negative integer for
%       each grid column.  If the top-most cell in column 'i' is partially
%       filled, then n(i)==0.
%
%   t - Fill degree of column's single partially filled cell.  One scalar
%       value between zero and one (inclusive, i.e., t \in [0,1]) for each
%       column.  If a column is completely filled (i.e., if n(i) equals the
%       number of cells in column 'i'), then t(i) is (arbitrarily) set to
%       zero.
%
% NOTE:
%   Assume column 'i' consists of N(i) cells.  Then, implicitly, the
%   saturation is s==1 in the n(i) first cells of this column.
%   Furthermore, s=t(i) in cell n(i)+1, and s==0 in the remaining
%   N(i) - (n(i) + 1) cells below the single, partially filled cell.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `integrateVertically`, `cumulativeHeight`.
