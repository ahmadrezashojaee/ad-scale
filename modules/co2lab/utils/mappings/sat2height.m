function h = sat2height(s, g, rock)
%Convert from saturation to height
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   h = sat2height(s, G, rock)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   s  - Saturation - one value for each cell in the underlying 3D model.
%        Corresponds to state.s for the 3D problem.
%
%   G  - A top-surface grid as defined by function 'topSurfaceGrid'.
%
%   rock - 3D rock data containing valid filed 'poro'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   h - Plume thickness.  One scalar value for each column in the top-surface 
%       grid.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `accumulateVertically`, `integrateVertically`
