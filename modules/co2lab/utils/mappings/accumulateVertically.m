function q = accumulateVertically(q, p)
%Accumulate quantity vertically per column.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   cq = accumulateVertically(q, pos)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   q   - Sampled quantity values.  One scalar value for each cell in each
%         column.
%
%   pos - Column indirection array.  Specifically,
%
%             pos(i) : pos(i + 1) - 1
%
%         are the indices in 'q' which correspond to column 'i'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   cq - Accumulated 'q' values.  Corresponds to CUMSUM(q), but reset per
%        column such that ALL(cq(pos(1 : end-1)) == 0).
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `topSurfaceGrid`, `cumsum`.
