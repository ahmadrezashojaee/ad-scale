function ph = cumulativePoreHeight(g, rock)
%Compute cumulative pore height for each column.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   ph = cumulativePoreHeight(G, rock)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Define the pore height of a cell c as dz(c)*phi(c).
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G    - A top-surface grid as defined by function 'topSurfaceGrid'.
%
%   rock - Rock data structure.  Must contain valid field 'rock.poro'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   pI - A G.cells.num-by-1 array of doubles such that
%
%           pv(G.cells.columnPos(i) : G.cells.columnPos(i+1)-1))
%
%        contains the cumulative pore height, measured from top-level z==0,
%        at the bottom interface of each 3D cell in column 'i'.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function is to the pore height what function cumulativeHeight is
%   to the incremental depth, G.columns.dz.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `topSurfaceGrid`, `cumulativeHeight`, `accumulateVertically`.
