function c = getInventoryColors(ind)
% Return colors used for plotting CO2 inventories (green to orange color)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   c = getInventoryColors(ind)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   ind - a scalar or vector consisting of one or more of the numbers one
%         to seven. These numbers signify the following parts of a CO2
%         inventory:
%            1 - dissolved
%            2 - residual (traps)
%            3 - residual
%            4 - residual (plume)
%            5 - movable (traps)
%            6 - movable (plume)
%            7 - leaked
%
% RETURNS:
%   c  - a numel(ind)x3 vector specifying one RGB color per entry in 'ind'
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   image(repmat(1:7,2,1)); colormap(getInventoryColors(1:7))

%   `interactiveTrapping`, `getVEColors`
