function [upneigh, nhood, tan_angle] = findUpslopeNeighbor(xyz, neighs, regions)
% Determine cell (or node) neighbors, and determine steepest upslope
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [upneigh, nhood] = findUpslopeNeighbor(xyz, neighbors, regions)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Determine cell (or node) neighbors, and determine steepest upslope.
%   Neighbors include diagonal neighbors and the cell (or node) itself, so
%   the max. number of neighbors is 9.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   xyz     - 3D coordinates of cells (or nodes)
%   neighs  - (n,2) list of the 'n' neighbor relations, where each line
%             gives the indices of two cells that are neighbors
%   regions - optional parameter that assigns a 'region' number to each
%             cell (or node).  Neighborhood relations across regions are
%             eliminated.
%
% RETURNS:
%   upneigh  - most upslope neighbor for each cell (or node).  Can be the
%              cell itself in case of a sommet node.
%   nhood    - a matrix giving the complete neighborhood of each cell (or
%              Each line represents a node, and contains the indices of
%              nodes in its neighborhood.  Number of columns is governed by
%              the largest neighborhood.  If a cell has fewer neighbors
%              than the number of columns, the surplus entries are given
%              the value zero.
%  tan_angle - tangent of the angle of the slope from the cell to its
%              upslope
%              neigh (optional output parameter)
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   To compute the cell neighborhood and upslope neighbors of cells in a
%   top surface grid 'Gt':
%   [upslope, neigh] = findUpslopeNeighbor([Gt.cells.centroids, Gt.cells.z],
%                                          Gt.faces.neighbors);
