function [uslp_neigh, region, spill_edges] = nodeSpillField(Gt, closed_bnodes, closed_fnodes)
% Compute the spill field for the 2D grid 'Gt'.
% The spill field consists of a classification of each of the nodes
% in the grid as belonging to a specific spill region.  A spill region is defined by 
% the nodes that all leads (i.e. guides the flow) up to a local maximum of the z-field. 
% The node at the maximum is flagged as a "sommet" node.
%
% SYNOPSIS
%   [upslope_neigh, region, spill_edges] = spill_field(Gt);
%
% PARAMETERS:
%    Gt            - a 2D grid with an associated z-field
%    closed_bnodes - vector with indices of nodes on the closed part of the
%                    boundary 
%    closed_fnodes - vector with indices of nodes along closed fault lines
% 
% RETURNS:    
%   uslp_neigh  - One element per node in Gt, containing the index of the
%                 'most (steepest) upslope' of its neighbor nodes, or '0'
%                 if it is a boundary node or sommet node (no upslope neighbor)
%   region      - a vector with one element per node in Gt.  The element gives the index
%                 of the spill region that the corresponding node belongs to.  Nodes with
%                 index 0 belong to the 'exterior' spill region.  Nodes with higher indices
%                 belong to a specific interior spill region.
%   spill_edges - Information about all spill edges in the grid.  A spill
%                 edge is defined as an edge whos two nodes belong to
%                 different spill region.  'spill_edges' is a matrix with one
%                 line per identified spill edge and seven columns, containing
%                 the following information about the spill edge:
%                    Col 1: index of spill edge (into Gt.faces)
%                    Col 2: region of edge's first node
%                    Col 3: region of edge's second node
%                    Col 4: z-value of edge's first node
%                    Col 5: z-value of edge's second node
%                    Col 6: index of edge's first node
%                    Col 7: index of edge's second node

% 
% SYNOPSIS
%   res = find_spill_edges(Gt, spill_field);
%
% PARAMETERS:
%            Gt - a 2D grid with assocated z-field.  The function will identify the
%                 spill edges of this grid.
%   spill_field - The precalculated spill_field of Gt (as calculated within the 
%                 'spill_field' function.
%
% RETURNS:
%   res - a matrix with seven columns and one line per identified spill edge.  The
%         columns represent the following information:
%         Col 1: index of spill edge (into Gt.faces)
%         Col 2: region of edge's first node
%         Col 3: region of edge's second node
%         Col 4: z-value of edge's first node
%         Col 5: z-value of edge's second node

%         Col 7: index of edge's second node
