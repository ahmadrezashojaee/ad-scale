function res = computeNodeTraps(Gt, closed_bnodes, closed_fnodes)
%
% Compute tracks and spill regions for the 2D surface grid 'Gt'.  The
% computation is node-based, not cell based.  Cell-based results can be
% obtained by subsequently applying the function n2cTraps ("node-to-cell
% traps"). 
% 
% SYNOPSIS
%    res = computeNodeTraps(Gt);
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%    Gt            - 2D-grid with z-values assigned to the nodes (Gt.nodes.z
%                    should exist). 
%    closed_bnodes - vector with indices of nodes on the closed part of the
%                    boundary 
%    closed_fnodes - vector with indices of nodes along closed fault lines
% 
% RETURNS: 
%    res - structure with the following fields:
%          traps           - one value per grid node. Zero for non-trap 
%                            nodes, trap number (from 1 upwards) for
%                            trap nodes. 
%          trap_zvals      - vector with one element per trap, giving
%                            the z-spill value for that trap
%          trap_sp_edge_ix - index(ices) of the edge(s) at the spill
%                            point(s) of each trap. There is typically
%                            only one spill point, but might be more in
%                            degenerate cases.  Therefore, the data is
%                            returned as a cell array rather than a
%                            vector or matrix. 
%          dstr_neigh      - one value per grid node.  Gives index of
%                            'most upstream' neighbor node, or '0' if
%                            there is no upstream neighbor (i.e. the
%                            node in question is a sommet or on the
%                            boundary. 
%          trap_regions    - one value per grid node.  Gives the number
%                            of the trap that the node spills into, or
%                            zero if the node spills out of the surface
%                            domain. 
%          connectivity    - (Sparse) adjacency matrix with one
%                            row/column per trap.  Row 'i' is nonzero
%                            only for columns 'j' where trap 'i' leads
%                            directly into trap 'j'.
%          rivers          - One cell array per trap, containing the
%                            'rivers' exiting that trap.  A river is
%                            presented as a sequence of consecutive grid
%                            nodes that lie geographically on the river.
%                            A river starts in the trap, and ends either
%                            in another trap or at the boundary of the
%                            domain.

%   spill_edges  - complete list of spill edges and associated

%                  as a matrix with one line per spill edge and seven 
%                  columns, giving the following information about the

%                  This matrix can be produced by the 'nodeSpillField'

% 
% SYNOPSIS:
% Compute the adjacencies between traps (i.e. which other trap(s) are
% spilled into when a given trap overflows.  The adjacencies are
% expressed as an adjacency matrix ('res_mat'). Each trap is represented
% as an group of local minima (of the top surface) that are  clustered
% together.  The grouping is expressed by a matrix ('reg_groupings')
% where the regions associated with each local minima are represented by
% the lines, and the clusters that constitutes the traps are represented
% by the columns. In order to determine the connections (which trap
% region spills into another), all spill edges are provided (c.f. the
% 'nodeSpillField' function for more information). 
%  
% PARAMETERS:
% reg_groupings - sparse matrix providing the information on which

%                 elements indicate which regions are included in each
%                 cluster.  Each region should belong to exactly one
%                 cluster.  If no regions are clustered together, this
%                 matrix should thus be the identity.
% spill_edges   - Information all spill edges resulting from the
%                 partitioning of the 2D surface grid.  These are all
%                 edges in the grid whose two nodes belong to two
%                 separate spill regions.  The information is presented

%                represents a trap.  Elements are either '1' (region 'i' is part of trap 'j') or 
%                '0' (region is not part of the trap).  Each region should belong to exactly 1 trap,
%                and each trap should contain one or more regions.
% spill_edges  - Information all spill edges resulting from the partitioning
%                of the 2D surface grid.  These are all edges in the grid
%                whose two nodes belong to two separate spill regions.  The
%                information is presented as a matrix with one line per
%                spill edge and seven columns, giving the following
%                information about the spill edge:
%                   Col 1: index of spill edge (into the underlying grid structure)
%                   Col 2: region of edge's first node
%                   Col 3: region of edge's second node
%                   Col 4: z-value of edge's first node
%                   Col 5: z-value of edge's second node
%                   Col 6: index of edge's first node
%                   Col 7: index of edge's second node
%                This matrix can be produced by the 'nodeSpillField' function.
