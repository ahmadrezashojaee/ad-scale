function [trap_ixs, vols] = downstreamTraps(Gt, poro, tstruct, trap_ix)
%
% Return index of all traps downstream of 'trap_ix'.  Also include
% 'trap_ix'.  If output argument 'vols' is provided, the trap volumes will
% also be computed.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [trap_ixs, vols] = downstreamTraps(Gt, poro, tstruct, trap_ix)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Gt      - Top surface grid in which the trap lies
%   poro    - Porosity field (one value per cell in Gt)
%   tstruct - trap structure og Gt, as computed by 'trapAnalysis'
%   trap_ix - index of starting trap
%
% RETURNS:
%   trap_ixs - Indices of all traps downstream of 'trap_ix', as well as
%              'trap_ix' itself
%   vols     - (optional) pore volumes of each downstream trap (one value per
%              entry in 'trap_ixs')
%
% SEE ALSO:
% `trapAnalysis`
