function Gt = flattenTraps(Gt, res)
% Given output res from trapAnalysis, produce a grid with flat top surfaces in trap areas.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   Gt = flattenTraps(Gt, res)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Gt  - Top surface grid
%
%   res - Output from trapAnalysis called on Gt.
%
% RETURNS:
%   Gt  - Gt where cells which are part of traps have had their z value
%   reduced to the level to the trap. Useful to make nice plots. This
%   function also adds the sortedCellNodes field to Gt if not present.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `interactiveTrapping`.
