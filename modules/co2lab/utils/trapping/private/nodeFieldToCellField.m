function cell_field = nodeFieldToCellField(Gt, node_field)
%
% Convert a field of node-based values to a field of cell-based values.
% Each node gets the value associed with the node with lowest z-value of its four
% corner nodes.
% This function was primarily written for projecting the spill-regions computed 
% based on nodes, onto cells.
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
% cell_field = nodeFieldToCellField(Gt, node_field) 
%
% PARAMETERS:
% Gt         - 2D grid for which the field of node-based values has been defined.
% node_field - the node-based field of values (e.g. spill region number)
% 
% RETURNS:
% cell_field - the cell-based field resulting from the projection of 'node_field' down
%              to the associated grid cells.
% 
% SEE ALSO: 
% `computeNodeTraps`
