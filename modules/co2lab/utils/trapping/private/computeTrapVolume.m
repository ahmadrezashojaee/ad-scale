function vol = computeTrapVolume(Gt, tstruct, poro, trap_ixs)
% Compute total pore volume of traps
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   vol = computeTrapVolume(Gt, tstruct, poro, trap_ix)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Gt       - top surface grid
%   tstruct  - trap structure of 'Gt', as produced by 'trapAnalysis'
%   poro     - porosity (one value per cell in Gt)
%   trap_ixs - indices of traps for which volume should be computed
%
% RETURNS:
%   vol - total pore volumes of the requested traps
%
% SEE ALSO:
% `trapAnalysis`
