function path = shortestPath(M, start, target)
%
% Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between two nodes.
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function path = shortestPath(M, start, target)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function computes the shortest path between two nodes in a
% connectivity graph with positive edge lengths.  The algorithm operates on
% non-sparse matrices, so it should only be used on relatively small graphs.
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%   M      - connectivity matrix, where nonzero entries indicate positive
%            distances.  M(i,j) > 0 indicates an edge between node i and j,
%            where the value of M(i,j) represents the distance.
%   start  - start node index
%   target - target node index
%
% RETURNS:
%   path - a vector of node indices indicating the shortest path from node
%   'start' to node 'target', or an empty vector if no such path exists.
