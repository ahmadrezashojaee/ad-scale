function [C,N, CC] = maxTPFAGravityMatrix(Gtop,varargin)
%Returns a matrix defining the maximal gravity connection of the top surface
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    C          = maxTPFAGravityMatrix(Gtop)
%    [C, N ]    = maxTPFAGravityMatrix(Gtop)
%    [C, N, CC] = maxTPFAGravityMatrix(Gtop)
%
% VARIABLES:
%    Gtop - grid structure for a top-surface grid
%
%    C    - matrix with maximal gravity connection
%
%    N    - 2*num_cells matrix defining the neibouring cells
%
%    CC   - matrix with maximal gravity connection including conections to
%           boundary. Boundary is defind as cell num_cells+1
%
%  'pn'/pv - List of 'key'/value pairs defining optional parameters.  The
%            supported options are:
%
%              use_multipoint -- locical to extend neighbours to nodebased
%                                stencile neighbours.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%    The routine constructs a matrix that represents the maximal gravity
%    connection of a top-surface grid. To this end, we define a two-point
%    connection between cells (i.e., two cells are connected only if they
%    share a common face) and from this graph, we define a subgraph in
%    which there exists a directed edge between a cell and the neighbour
%    that has the largest height difference in cell centroids. In addition,
%    bi-directional edges are added to all neighbouring cells having a zero
%    height difference. The resulting graph defines an approximation to the
%    direction in which a light fluid will migrate at an infinitesimaly
%    slow rate.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%    To demonstrate how to use the maximal gravity connection, we will use
%    graph routines from the MatlabBGL to investigate the connections.
%
%    C = maxTPFAGravityMatrix(Gtop);
%
%    Find the accumulation or drainage area of each local maximum. To
%    this end, we replace the unidirectional connections by bi-directional
%    connections and find the strongly connected components of the
%    resulting undirected graph
%
%    [ci,ss] = components(C+C');
%
%    Find all cells that are in the accumulation/drainage area of a given
%    cell. To this end, we can either use a depth-first search or a
%    breadth-first search
%
%    cc=dfs(C',cell)
%    cc=bfs(C',cell)
%
%    Likewise, we can determine cells that are upstream of a given cell
%
%    cc=dfs(C,cell)
%    cc=bfs(C,cell)
