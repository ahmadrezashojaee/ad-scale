function v = volumesOfTraps(Gt, res, traps, varargin)
% Compute volumes of (a subset of) precomputed structural traps
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
%   v = volumesOfTraps(Gt, res, varargin)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Gt       - top surface grid
%   res      - trap structure, as computed by trapAnalysis
%   traps    - vector with indices of traps for which to compute volumes.  If
%              empty, volumes are computed for _all_ traps.
%   varargin - keyword/value pairs for additional parameters.  Possible
%              options are:
%              * 'poro' - vector of porosities (default 1)
%              
%
% RETURNS:
%   v - vector containing volumes for each specified trap
%       NB: The volumes computes are total volumes, not pore volumes!
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `trapAnalysis`
