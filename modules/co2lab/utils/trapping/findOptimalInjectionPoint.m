function [cell, largestVol, allFaces, point, traps] = findOptimalInjectionPoint(G, res)
%Find the optimal point to inject CO2
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [cell, largestVol, allFaces, point] = findOptimalInjectionPoint(G, res)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Finds the best possible point to inject CO2. It is done by assuming
%   that the best injection point is at the interface between two trap
%   regions which together correspond to the largest trap trees.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G   - Top surface grid.
%   res - trapAnalysis output.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   None.
%
% RETURNS:
%   cell - Global cell index of best possible injection point.
%
%   largestVol - Structural trapping volume reachable from this point.
%
%   allFaces   - The fine faces corresponding to the interface between the
%                two trapping regions of the optimal point.
%
%   point      - The centroid of cell.
