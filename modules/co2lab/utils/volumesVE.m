function vol = volumesVE(G, sol, rock, fluid, ts)
% SYNOPSIS:
%   vol = volumesVE(G, sol, rock, fluid)
%   vol = volumesVE(G, sol, rock, fluid, ts)
%   
% PARAMETERS:
%   G      - 2D top surface grid used for VE-simulations
%   sol    - Solution state as defined by initResSolVE
%   rock   - rock for the top surface grid
%   fluid  - fluid object
%   ts     - trapping structure object, typically returned by a call to
%            'findTrappingStructure'
% 
% RETURNS:
%   a vector with trapped and free volumes. If no trapping structure is
%   provided, the vector consists of two entries:
%      - the residual CO2 saturation in regions where the CO2 plume has
%        moved out, defined as the difference between h_max and h
%      - the free residual volume defined as the height of the CO2
%        colum in each cell multiplied by the pore volume of the cell
%        and the residual CO2 saturation
%      - free volume defined as the height of CO2 column in each cell
%        multiplied by the pore volume of the cell and the CO2
%        saturation minus the residual CO2 saturation
%   If a trapping structure is provided, the vector consists of five
%   entries:
%      - residual volumes of CO2 confined to structural traps
%      - residual volume of CO2 left in cells the CO2 plume has
%        moved out of
%      - fraction of the free volume that will remain as residual CO2
%        when the plume moves away from its current location
%      - movable volumes of CO2 confined in structural traps
%      - fraction of the CO2 plume that is free to leave the current
%        position (i.e., will not remain as residually trapped)
%  
%        The five entries of the vector can be summarized using the below table:

%                                        -------- entry of 'vol' -------
%        | Zone/type                     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
%        |-------------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|
%        | In trap                       | yes | no  | no  | yes | no  |
%        | Outside trap                  | no  | yes | yes | no  | yes |
%        | Residual                      | yes | yes | yes | no  | no  |
%        | In presence of free flow (<h) | y/n | no  | yes | yes | yes |
