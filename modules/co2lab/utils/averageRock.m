function rock2D = averageRock(rock, g_top)
% Average version of rock for use in vertical averaging
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   rock = averageRock(rock, g_top)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   rock    - rock structure for 3D grid.  
%
%   g_top   - top surface 2D grid as defined by function 'topSurfaceGrid'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   rock2D  - rock structure with porosities and (lateral) permeability
%             averaged for each column, as well as net-to-gross (ntg)
%             values averaged for each column if ntg is a field of rock
%             structure.
