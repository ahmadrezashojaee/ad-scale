function dh = computeToptraps(trapfun, Gt, recenter)
%
% Compute subscale trapping potential for all cells in a top surface grid,
% based on a precomputed trap function.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function dh = computeToptraps(trapfun, Gt, recenter)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   trapfun  - precomputed trap function (As computed by e.g. 'resTiltUtsira.m')
%   Gt       - top surface grid
%   recenter - whether or not to 'recenter', i.e. adjust angle so that maximum
%              subscale trapping is obtained when surface is horizontal
%
% RETURNS:
%   dh - vector with one entry per cell of 'Gt', giving the subscale trapping
%        potential for each cell.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `resTiltUtsira`
