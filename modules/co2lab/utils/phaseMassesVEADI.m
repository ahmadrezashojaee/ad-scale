function masses = phaseMassesVEADI(Gt, state, rock, fluid)
% Compute column masses of undissolved gas, fluid, and dissolved gas.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function masses = phaseMassesVEADI(Gt, sol, rock, fluidADI)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Gt       - Top surface grid
%   sol      - solution structure containing a valid 'state' structure field
%   rock     - rock structure corresponding to 'Gt'
%   fluidADI - ADI fluid object.  Used to get densities and compressibilities
%
% RETURNS:
%   masses - Matrix with one row per cell and three columns.  The first
%            column gives the mass of undissolved gas per cell.  The second
%            column gives the mass of fluid (water/oil) per cell.  The third
%            column gives the mass of gas dissolved in fluid per cell.
