The MRST Numerical CO2 Laboratory combines results of more than one decade of academic research and development of mathematical models and numerical methods for CO2 storage modeling combined into a unified toolchain that is easy and intuitive to use. The software is flexible and efficient and can be used to study realistic injection scenarios, or function as a platform for rapid prototyping of new models and computational methods.

Different vertical equilibrium models are included, ranging from simple incompressible immiscibile two-phase models to compressible models with CO2 dissolution. A range of interactive tools makes it easy to visualize how CO2 will migrate and behave under different conditions and for different saline aquifers.

The module offers:

- simplified access to public data sets from the CO2 Storage Atlas of the Norwegian Continental Shelf

- identification of structural traps and computation of storage capacity estimates

- vertical-equilibrium methods specifically to study long-term, large-scale migration

- detailed carbon trapping inventories

- a large number of tutorials and examples

- optimization methods

- complete simulation setups from published papers, to support reproducible research
