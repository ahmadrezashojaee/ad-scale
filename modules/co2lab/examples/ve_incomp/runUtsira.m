%% Simulate long term migration on the Utsira formation
% This example demonstrates simulation of long-term migration of CO2 in the
% Utsira formation using incompressible flow and Dirichlet pressure
% boundary conditions. CO2 is injected in the cell nearest to the Sleipner
% field where CO2 injection is ongoing.

%% Set up fluid properties and hydrostatic pressure
% We define approximate hydrostatic pressure for a set of z values to use
% as initial values:
%
% $$ P = P_0 + rho_{water}\cdot \delta h g_z $$
%
% At the same time, we define the physical properties of CO2 and water at
% our reference pressure.
%
% We also define a coarsening of the full Utsira grid. The full grid
% contains a fairly large number of cells, so we coarse by a factor 3. This
% can be changed to a higher  or lower number depending on the available
% processing power and the patience of the user.

%% Set up injection parameters
% We inject a yearly amount of 1 Mt/year (which is approximately the same
% as the current injection at Sleipner) for a period of 100 years, followed
% by 4900 years of migration.  During injection the timesteps are smaller
% than during migration.

T_inj =  100*year;

N = 20;
dT_inj  = T_inj / N;  % short time steps during injection
dT_long = dT_inj*5;   % longer steps during migration

% ~ 1Mt annual injection
rate = 1e9*kilogram/(year*rhoc*kilogram*meter^3);

% Approximate position of the Sleipner field
sleipnerPos = [438514, 6472100];

%% Set up a grid corresponding to the Utsira formation
% The Sleipner field has a history of CO2 injection. It is embedded in the
% Utsira formation. We will demonstrate how the larger formation grids can
% be used to simulate long term migration.

[grids, info, petrodata] = getAtlasGrid('Utsirafm', 'nz', 5, 'coarsening', nc);

% Store heightmap data for contour plots
info = info(cellfun(@(x) strcmpi(x.variant, 'top'), info));
info = info{1};

G = processGRDECL(grids{1});

% Depending on the coarsening factor, occasionally very small subsets of
% cells may become disconnected. We guard against this by taking only the
% first grid returned by processGRDECL,  which is guaranteed by
% processGRDECL to be the one with the most cells.

%% Plot grid along with top surface
% We downshift the full grid to plot it alongside with the top surface. We
% also add a simple light to show the surface variation in height, which
% highlights regions where structural trapping is possible. 
%
% To show the relation to the original dataset, we plot contour lines on
% the original height data. Note that as the final grid is the intersection
% between the provided height and thickness datasets, some contour lines do
% not correspond to any part of the grid.

%% Set up well and boundary conditions
% This example is using an incompressible model for both rock and fluid. If
% we assume no-flow on the boundary, this will result in zero flow from a
% single injection well. However, this can be compensated if we use the
% physical understanding of the problem to set appropriate boundary
% conditions: The Utsira formation is enormous compared to the volume of
% the injected CO2. Thus, it is impossible that the injection will change
% the composition of the formation significantly. We therefore assume that
% the boundary conditions can be set equal to hydrostatic pressure to drive
% flow.
