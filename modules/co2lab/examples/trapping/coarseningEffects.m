%% Johansen formation: the effect of coarsening on trapping
% When working with subsea reservoirs coarsening will always be a factor:
%
% * Simulations on very large grids become prohibitively expensive in terms
% of computing power very fast.
% * All grids are essentially coarse approximations of highly complex
% geometry. Different grids have a different scale for each cell depending
% on what kind of data was used to produce the grid in the first place and
% the intended usage of the datasets.
%
% This example demonstrates the effects of geometry coarsening on a model
% from the CO2 Storage Atlas grids, with a special focus on structural
% trapping. To this end, we generate six realizations of the Johansen
% formation: The first is the full dataset, the second coarsened by a
% factor 2 in both i and j directions, the third a factor 3, and so on.
% This gives a set of grids where the finest has approximately 80,000
% cells, while the most coarse has ~2,000 cells. In the finest grid, each
% cell has a resolution of 500x500 m^2 per cell, while the coarsest has
% 3000x3000 m^2. The resolution in both grids is fairly large in compared
% with typical simulation grids in petroleum application.

%% The effect of coarsening on trapping analysis
% It is obvious that fine structural details are lost when coarsening the
% grids. The coarsening operation acts as a smoother on the grid, removing
% ridges, folds and oscillations that are present on a shorter wavelength
% than the coarse cells. Unfortunately, these small oscillations are
% especially interesting for CO2 migration studies: Small local height
% maxima can divert small "rivers" of CO2 and act as structural traps.
%
% To demonstrate that these traps are lost when coarsening, we plot the
% structural traps estimated by trapAnalysis for the different grids. Note
% that several smaller traps are removed as the coarsening increases, which
% can be shown statistically by noting that the mean of the trap volume
% quickly increases as the smaller traps are smoothed away. 
%
% The total trapping volume also changes as the coarsening is increased: In
% the beginning the volume increases as the largest traps become slightly
% larger due to the lower resolution. Later on, the total volume shrinks as
% smaller traps are removed entirely.
