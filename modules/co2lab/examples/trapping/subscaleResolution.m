%% Effects of scales structures on trapping capacity
% The CO2 Storage Atlas grids are very coarse, even at the finest
% resolution supplied. As they cover vast scales and were meant for
% mapping, this is to be expected.
%
% To give an indication of the subscale morphology and potential traps that
% are not resolved in the atlas models, we will use a data model of
% Sleipner, which is the world's first subsea CO2 storage site and is
% located in the larger Utsira formation. The model was originally
% developed by Statoil has much higher spatial resolution. The model was
% publicly released by IEA and could be downloaded from their webpage by
% registred users:
% http://www.ieaghg.org/index.php?/20110329248/sleipner-benchmark-model.html
%
% Altogether, the example shows the importance of using fine-scale
% resolution when simulating long-term migration because coarsening may
% have a large impact on the trapped CO2 volumes.

%% Estimate the unresolved local oscillations per area
% We find the total trap volume for Sleipner and divide it by the total
% area of the Sleipner case to find a rough estimate of the trap volume per
% area from small-scale oscillations.
%
% Note that we are always using volume in the geometrical sense: To find
% the amount of CO2 stored, both a porosity and a reference density of CO2
% is required.

%% Get another estimate by removing global trends
% This estimate is obviously quite large as there may be global traps
% included in the fine Utsira grid that are counted twice. As we are
% primarily interested in structural traps that are smaller than what can
% be resolved by the coarse grid, we can obtain a more conservative
% estimate by removing the overall trends in the Utsira grid from the
% Sleipner grid and recomputing the traps. This is done by creating an
% interpolant from the Utsira top-surface grid and sampling the interpolant
% in the corresponding fine coordinates to obtain new z values.
%
% The three grids are plotted: Note how the adjusted grid (in green) has
% less curvature as it intersects the original grid, while having less traps
% volume. The largest trap is significantly reduced once the trend has been
% removed.
