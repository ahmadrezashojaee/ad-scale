function [ P_over ] = computeOverburdenPressure( Gt, rock2D, ...
    seafloor_depth, water_density, varargin )
% Compute overburden pressure acting on top of a formation, which is due to
% the weight of all overlying layers (fluid + solid). Here, we assume
% overlying formation is made up of same rock and fluid type as found in
% storage formation (i.e., rock porosity, water density)
%
% Inputs:
%   Gt                - 2D grid, as generated using topSurfaceGrid
%   rock2D            - rock structure, containing poro (porosity)
%   seafloor_depth    - depth to seafloor
%   water_density     - density of overlying formation fluid
%
% Optional:
%   seawater_density  - density of seawater
%   rock_density      - dry bulk density of overlying formation rock
%
% Outputs:
%   P_over            - overburden pressure, in Pascals
