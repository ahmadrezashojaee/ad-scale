%   cellSubtract                     - we assume that a and b should be single-indexed
%   computeOverburdenPressure        - Compute overburden pressure acting on top of a formation, which is due to
%   findMaxPercentagePlimitReached   - Determine maximum percentage of pressure limit (or overburden pressure)
%   leak_penalizer_at_infinity_Rerun - Purpose: to compute the obj value at each time-step:
%   leakAtInfinity                   - computes mass (in Gt) leaked by time infinity as long as penalty is set
%   leakPenalizerAtInfinity          - new objective function to penalize leakage 'felt' at infinity, using
%   makeBjarmelandModel              - Simple Bjarmeland model for testing pressure-limited injection
%   maxPressureViolation             - states.pressure is a cell array.
%   postProcessExample               - Post-processing of Bjarmeland pressure-limited example
%   pressureAtCells                  - states.pressure is a cell array.
%   pressurePenalizer                - Penalize pressure of specific or all cells.
