%Add in fluxes imposed by sources and face boundary conditions
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Utility function for updating residual conservation equations in the AD
%   framework with additional fluxes due to boundary conditions and
%   sources. Wells are handled separately in WellModel.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model      - Simulation model (subclass of ReservoirModel).
%
%   eqs        - Residual conservation of mass-equations for each phase, in
%                the order WATER, OIL, GAS (with any inactive phases
%                omitted) as a cell array.
%
%  (All the following arguments are cell arrays, with length equal to the
%  number of the active phases, with the values for each cell in each
%  entry unless otherwise noted)
%
%   pressure   - Phase pressures
%   rho        - Surface densities (one value per phase)
%   mob        - Phase mobilities
%   b          - Phase b-factors (volume in reservoir to standard conditions)
%   s          - Phase saturations
%
%   forces     - Struct containing .src and .bc fields for sources and
%                boundary conditions respectively.
%
% RETURNS:
%   eqs         - Phase conservation equations with added fluxes.
%
%   qBC         - Phase fluxes due to BC at standard conditions.
%
%   BCTocellMap - Matrix mapping qBC to cells.
%
%   qSRC        - Phase fluxes due to source terms.
%
%   srcCells    - List of cells, mapping qSRC to cells.
