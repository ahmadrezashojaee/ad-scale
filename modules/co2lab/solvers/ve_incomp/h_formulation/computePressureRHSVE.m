%Compute right-hand side contributions to pressure linear system.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [f, g, h, grav, dF, dC] = computePressureRHSVE(G, omega, bc, src, state)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G     - Grid data structure.
%
%   omega - Accumulated phase densities \rho_i weighted by fractional flow
%           functions f_i -- i.e., omega = \sum_i \rho_i f_i.  One scalar
%           value for each cell in the discretised reservoir model, G.
%
%   pc    - second-order term in the pressure equation ("capillary
%           pressure" function, fluid.pc).
%
%   bc    - Boundary condition structure as defined by function 'addBC'.
%           This structure accounts for all external boundary conditions to
%           the reservoir flow.  May be empty (i.e., bc = struct([])) which
%           is interpreted as all external no-flow (homogeneous Neumann)
%           conditions.
%
%   src   - Explicit source contributions as defined by function
%           'addSource'.  May be empty (i.e., src = struct([])) which is
%           interpreted as a reservoir model without explicit sources.
%
%   state - Reservoir solution structure holding reservoir state.
%
% RETURNS:
%   f, g, h - Pressure (f), source/sink (g), and flux (h) external
%             conditions.  In a problem without effects of gravity, these
%             values may be passed directly on to linear system solvers
%             such as 'schurComplementSymm'.
%
%   grav    - Pressure contributions from gravity.  One scalar value for
%             each half-face in the model (size(G.cells.faces,1)).
%
%   dF, dC  - Packed Dirichlet/pressure condition structure.  The faces in
%             'dF' and the values in 'dC'.  May be used to eliminate known
%             face pressures from the linear system before calling a system
%             solver (e.g., 'schurComplementSymm').
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `addBC`, `addSource`, `computeMimeticIP`, `schurComplementSymm`.
