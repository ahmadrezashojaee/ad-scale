function p = applySuccessivePart(p, G, indicator, NU, pfixed)
%Refine blocks by successively applying static background partitions
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = applySuccessivePart(p, G, I, NU, pf)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Given a partition 'p' of a grid 'G', this function applies a set of
%   fixed subdivisions pf(:,1) to pf(:,end) successively to coarse blocks
%   in the grid. In each block, the next subdivision in the succession is
%   only applied if the accumulative indicator inside the block exceeds a
%   prescribed threshold. The indicator function 'I' is interpreted as a
%   density and multiplied by the cell volume to derive the total indicator
%   value for each cell. No block should have a total accumulated indicator
%   value exceeding "NU / G.cells.num" times the total accumulated
%   indicator value for the whole grid,
%
%       SUM(I .* G.cells.volumes)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p  - Partition vector.
%
%   G  - Grid data structure
%
%   I  - Cell-wise value of some indicator density function used to
%        decide whether the next partition should be applied inside
%
%   NU - Upper bound on indicator values per block.  Positive scalar.
%
%   pf - A predefined set of partition vectors which are substituted into
%        each coarse block with indicator values that are too large.  If
%        the fixed partition is a (G.cells.num)-by-m matrix, the columns
%        are each applied once, in sequence of increasing column numbers.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function uses features of the 'coarsegrid' module, which must be
%   loaded before using the function.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p -  Partition vector after refinement.  The partition vector contains
%        connected, non-empty blocks only because the final step of
%        function 'applySuccessivePart' is to pass the vector through the
%        functions 'compressPartition' and 'processPartition' from the
%        'coarsegrid' module.
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   G = computeGeometry(cartGrid([5 5]));
%   p1 = partitionCartGrid(G.cartDims, [2 1]);
%   p2 = partitionCartGrid(G.cartDims, [1 2]);
%   p = ones(G.cells.num,1);
%   p = applySuccessivePart(p, G, p, 12, [p1 p2]);
%   plotCellData(G,p,'EdgeColor','k');
