function [sgn, coarse_f] = signOfFineFacesOnCoarseFaces(G, CG, nsub, sub)
%Identify fine-scale flux direction corresponding to coarse-scale outflow
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [sgn, coarse_f] = signOfFineFacesOnCoarseFaces(G, CG, nsub, sub)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Generates a vector sgn which gives the sign that the fine fluxes should
%   be multiplied with, before summed along a coarse grid interface to
%   obtain a coarse net flux. The vector coarse_f gives the coarse face
%   number corresponding to the fine grid faces in the coarse grid.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G    - Grid structure
%
%   CG   - Coarse grid sturcture.
%
%   nsub - Number of fine-grid faces belonging to each individual coarse
%          grid face.
%
%   sub  - Actual fine-grid subfaces represented in a condensed storage
%          format.
%
% RETURNS:
%   sgn      - Sign of the fine-grid subface flux to be multiplied with
%              the corresponding flux, before summed along the coare
%              interface to give the coarse net flux.
%
%   coarse_f - The coarse face number for each fine-grid subface.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `subFaces`
