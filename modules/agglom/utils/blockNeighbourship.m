function bN = blockNeighbourship(N, p, varargin)
%Derive coarse-scale neighbourship from fine-scale information
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   bN = blockNeighbourship(N, p)
%   bN = blockNeighbourship(N, p, f)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   N  - Fine-scale neighbourship definition.  Often, but not necessarily
%        always, equal to the 'faces.neighbors' field of a grid structure.
%
%   p  - Partition vector defining coarse blocks.
%
%   f  - Optional boolean flag that, if set, includes the external boundary
%        into the inter-block connection set.  Default value: unset/false
%        whence external boundary is excluded from neighbourship relations.
%
% RETURNS:
%   bN - Coarse-scale (block) neighbourship definition (unique inter-block
%        connections).
%
% NOTE:
%   This function uses SORTROWS.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `grid_structure`, `generateCoarseGrid`, `sortrows`.
