function p = mergeBlocksByConnections(G, p, T, minBlockSize)
%Merge blocks based on connection strength
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = mergeBlocksByConnections(G, partition, T, minBlockSize)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   An alternate merging algorithm based on face connections.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G    - Grid structure
%
%   p    - Partition vector with one entry per cell in G.
%
%   T    - Connection strength. One entry per face in G, including boundary
%          faces. Negative weights are interpreted as zero connections.
%
%   mz   - Minimum block size. The algorithm terminates when all coarse
%          blocks have at least mz fine cells.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p    - Modified partition vector.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `mergeBlocks`, `mergeBlocks2`
