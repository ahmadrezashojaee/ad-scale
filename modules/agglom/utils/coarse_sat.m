function sc = coarse_sat(s, p, pv, nc)
% Converts a fine saturation field to a coarse saturation field, weighted
% with pore volumes.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   sc = coarse_sat(s, partition, pv, nc)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Converts a fine saturation field to a coarse saturation field, weighted
%   with pore volumes.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   s           - Fine saturation field
%   partitition - A partition vector representing the coarse grid
%   pv          - the pore volumes of the fine grid cells.
%                 pv=poreVolume(G, rock) at the fine scale.
%   nc          - Number of coarse grid blocks.
%
% RETURNS:
%   sc - Coarse saturation field, length nc.
