function conn = blockConnectivity(N)
%Build block-to-neighbours map by transposing neighbourship definition
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   conn = blockConnectivity(N)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   N - Neighbourship definition.  An m-by-2 array of explicit connections,
%       akin to the 'faces.neighbors' field of the grid structure.
%
% RETURNS:
%   conn - Connectivity structure.  A B-by-1 cell array of
%          block-to-neighbour associations.  Specifically, the neighbours
%          of block 'b' are found in conn{b}.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `blockNeighbours`, `blockNeighbourship`.
