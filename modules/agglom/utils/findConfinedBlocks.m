function [blks, pn] = findConfinedBlocks(G, p)
%Identify coarse blocks confined entirely within a single other block.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   blks       = findConfinedBlocks(G, p)
%   [blks, pn] = findConfinedBlocks(G, p)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - Grid structure.
%
%   p  - Partition vector defining coarse blocks.
%
% RETURNS:
%   blks - List of blocks that are confined inside another block, i.e.,
%          have only one neigbour in the interior of the grid.
%          NB! In the case of recursively confined blocks, only the
%          outermost and the innermost blocks will be listed in blks.
%
%   pn   - New partition in which each confined block is merged with the
%          block that surrounds it. NB! Will not work for nested
%          confinement.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   % single confined block
%   G = cartGrid([4 4]);
%   p = ones(4,4); p(2,2) = 2; p(3:4,4)=3; p(4,2:3)=4;
%   blks = findConfinedBlocks(G,p(:));
%
%   % recursively confined blocks
%   G = cartGrid([7 4]);
%   p = ones(7,4); p(2:6,1:3)=2; p(3:5,1:2) = 3; p(4,1)=4;
%   [b, pn] = findConfinedBlocks(G,p(:));
