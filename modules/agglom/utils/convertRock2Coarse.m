function rock_cg = convertRock2Coarse(G, CG, rock)
%Create coarse-scale porosity field for solving transport equation.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   rock_cg = convertRock2Coarse(G, CG, rock)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Computes coarse scale porosity as a volume-weighted average of
%   fine scale porosites within each coarse block.
%
%   Does not produce a coarse scale equivalent of rock.perm, whence the
%   coarse scale rock data is unsuited to models involving gravity forces.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G    - A grid_structure.
%
%   CG   - Coarse grid data sturcture as defined by function
%         'generateCoarseGrid'.
%
%   rock - Rock data structure with an accumulated porosity field.
%
% RETURNS:
%   rock_cg - Rock data structure defined on coarse grid, 'CG'.
