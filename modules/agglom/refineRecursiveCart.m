function p = refineRecursiveCart(p, G, indicator, NU, cartDims)
%Refine blocks by recursively applying Cartesian refinement pattern
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = refineRecursiveCart(p, G, I, NU, cartDims)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Given a partition 'p' of a grid 'G', this function recursively
%   subdivides each coarse block in which the accumulated block indicators
%   'I' exceed an upper limit.  The subdivision is done according to a
%   prescribed Cartesian refinement pattern.
%
%   Here, 'I' is interpreted as a density and multiplied by the cell volume
%   to derive the total indicator value for each cell.  No block should
%   have a total accumulated indicator value exceeding "NU / G.cells.num"
%   times the total accumulated indicator value for the whole grid,
%
%       SUM(I .* G.cells.volumes)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p  - Partition vector.
%
%   G  - Grid data structure discretising the reservoir model.
%
%   I  - Cell-wise value of some measure/indicator function used for
%        deciding which blocks to refine.
%
%   NU - Upper bound on indicator values per block.
%
%   cartDims -
%        Rectangular subdivison based on the bounding box of each coarse
%        grid block.
%
% NOTE:
%   This function uses features of the 'gridtools' and 'coarsegrid' modules
%   so those modules must be active in order to use function
%   'refineRecursiveCart'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p - Partition vector after refinement.  The partition vector contains
%       connected, non-empty blocks only because the final step of function
%       'refineRecursiveCart' is to pass the vector through the functions
%       'compressPartition' and 'processPartition' from the 'coarsegrid'
%       module.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `applySuccessivePart`, `sampleFromBox`, `compressPartition`, `processPartition`.
