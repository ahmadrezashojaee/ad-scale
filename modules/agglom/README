The module consists of a set of modular components that can be combined in different ways to create coarse grids that adapt to geology and flow fields. The fundamental characteristic of all algorithms is that coarse blocks are generated by amalgamating cells from the original fine grid, with cell-wise indicator functions guiding the amalgamation directions and the new grid resolution.

See the 'coarsegrid' module for simpler partition methods and data structures for representing coarse grids.
