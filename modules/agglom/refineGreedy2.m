function p = refineGreedy2(p, G, IFlw, NU, varargin)
%Refine blocks in a partition using a greedy algorithm
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = refineGreedy2(p, G, IFlw, NU)
%   p = refineGreedy2(p, G, IFlw, NU, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The function performs a greedy refinement of all blocks in which the
%   (flow-based) indicator exceeds a prescribed upper bound. In each block,
%   the algorithm picks the cell that is furthest away from the block
%   center and starts growing a new block inward by adding neighbours
%   until the upper bound on the indicator is exceeded. This process is
%   repeated until the sum of the indicator values of the remaining
%   cells inside the block is below the threshold.
%
%   Compared with 'refineGreedy', which grows a ring of neighbouring cells
%   at the time, 'refineGreedy2' is slightly more sophisticated (and
%   computationally expensive). The method may grow only parts of the
%   neighbouring ring to ensure that the upper bound is not violated.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p      - Partition vector.  Possibly created by function
%            'segmentIndicator' or some other partitioning algorithm.  The
%            input partition vector should not contain any disconnected
%            blocks.  Function 'processPartition' will split such blocks.
%
%   G      - Grid structure.
%
%   IFlw   - Block flow indicator.  One non-negative scalar, interpreted as
%            a density, for each cell in the grid 'G'.  The algorithm will
%            merge a candidate block to its (feasible) neighbouring block
%            that most closely matches its own block flow.
%
%   NU     - Algorithm controlling parameter.  The algorithm will refine
%            blocks with too much flow--i.e., blocks for which
%
%                IFlw(B) |B| >= (NU / n) IFlw(G) |G|    (*)
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   nlevel   - Specifies the definition of neighbourship used in the greedy
%              algorithm. Level 1 uses only the face neighbors, while level
%              2 also includes cells that have faces in common with at
%              least two of the level-1 neighbours. Level-3 neighbours are
%              all cells that share at least one node.
%              Default: nlevel = 2
%
%   verbose  - Whether or not display number of blocks in the resulting
%              partition. Default value dependent upon global verbose
%              setting of function 'mrstVerbose'.
% RETURNS:
%   p      - Updated partition vector.  Typically contains more blocks
%            than the input partition vector.  None of the resulting blocks
%            should violate the criterion (*).
