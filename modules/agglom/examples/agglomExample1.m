%% Example 1: The Nonuniform Coarsening Algorithm
% Our first example shows the four basic steps of the nonuniform coarsening
% algorithm proposed by Aarnes et al. [1]. The algorithm is an ad hoc
% approach for creating a coarse grid that distinguishes high-flow and
% low-flow regions, thereby trying to mimic a streamline-type grid without
% moving grid points. The algorithm consists of four steps:
%
% # Segment log(|v)| to get an initial partition.
% # Merge blocks whose volumes are below a lower limit.
% # Refine blocks in which the flow exceeds an upper limit
% # Repeat Step 2 and terminate.
%
% The algorithm is a special case of a more general framework for creating
% coarse grids based on amalgamation of cells from a fine grid, as
% described by Hauge et al. [2].

%% Create a simple model
% We consider an 8x8 Cartesian grid with an artificial flow indicator in
% the form of a sine-wave making an angle with the coordinate directions.
G = computeGeometry(cartGrid([8 8]));
iVel = sin(pi*(G.cells.centroids(:,1) + G.cells.centroids(:,2))/3);
iVel = iVel - min(iVel) + 1;
iVol = ones(size(iVel));
NL  = 4;
NU  = 8;

%% Segement indicator
% In the first step, we segment the indicator value into ten bins to
% distinguish the high-flow and low-flow zones.
p1 = segmentIndicator(G, iVel, 10);
plotCoarseningStep(p1, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU, 1, 1);

%% Merge blocks
% The segmentation will typically create a speckle of small blocks that we
% do not want in our coarse grid. We therefore merge blocks that have a
% volume less than NL times the average cell volume with the neighboring
% block that has the closest iVel value.
p2 = mergeBlocks2(p1, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU);
plotCoarseningStep(p2, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU, 2, 1);

%% Refine blocks
% In the next step we check if there are any blocks in which the iVel
% indicator exceeds the prescribed upper bound and if so we refine these
% blocks. To this end, we use a greedy algorithm that starts at one cell
% and grows a new block until the upper bound is exceeded. If necessary,
% the process is repeated.
p3 = refineGreedy(p2, G, iVel, NU);
plotCoarseningStep(p3, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU, 3, 1);

%% Merge blocks
% The greedy refinement may have created some small cells (typically if
% the blocks to be refined only slightly exceed the upper bound). We
% therefore perform a second merging step to get rid of blocks that have
% too small volume.
p4 = mergeBlocks2(p3, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU);
plotCoarseningStep(p4, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU, 4, 1);

%% Improved refinement algorithm - part 1
% The |refineGreedy| routine grows blocks somewhat agressively by adding
% rings of neighbouring cells at the time. The |refineGreedy2| method only
% adds the neighbouring cells necessary to reach the upper limit.
p3 = refineGreedy2(p2, G, iVel, NU);
p5 = mergeBlocks2(p3, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU);
plotCoarseningStep(p5, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU, 4, 1);

%%
% With such small grid blocks, the algorithm does not have many choices and
% therefore produces a grid with two blocks that violate the upper bound.
% In general, it is our experience that |refineGreedy2| produces better
% results than the original algorithm proposed by Aarnes et al.

%% Improved refinement algorithm - part 2
% Alternatively, we can use the |refineGreedy3| method which sorts the
% neighbouring cells in descending order by the number of faces shared with
% cells in the growing block. Unfortunately, the method is quite expensive
% and its use is not recommended for very large models.
p3 = refineGreedy3(p2, G, iVel, NU, 'nlevel',1);
p6 = mergeBlocks2(p3, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU);
plotCoarseningStep(p6, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU, 4, 1);

%%
% In this particular example, the resulting grid has the same number of
% violations as for |refineGreedy2|, but one of the blocks now has a
% stronger violation. In our experience, it is generally hard to create
% grids that satisfy both constraints and these should generally be seen as
% soft (and indicatory) bounds.

%% Improved refinement algorithm - part 3
% As a fourth alternative, we can use the |refineGreedy4| method
% in which the neighbouring cells are sorted in descending order in terms
% of the discrepancy between the flow indicator value in each neighbour
% cell and the growing block.
p3 = refineGreedy4(p2, G, iVel, NU, 'nlevel',1);
p7 = mergeBlocks2(p3, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU);
plotCoarseningStep(p7, G, iVol, iVel, NL, NU, 4, 1);

%%
% In this particular example, the result is no better than for
% |refineGreedy2|. However, the method may be quite useful in some other
% examples.
