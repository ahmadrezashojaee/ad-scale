%% Model with two facies
% As a first case, we consider 40x40 fine grid for which the image
% 'facies1.png' represents some geological object that is defined on a
% background. In our gridding, we will make sure that the object is
% represented also in the coarse model. To this end, we will partition the
% grid into a uniform 5x5 coarse grid and in addition preserve the edges
% of the object.
exdir = fullfile(mrstPath('agglom'), 'examples');
if isempty(exdir), exdir = pwd; end
imload = @(fn) ...
   flipud(double(sum(imread(fullfile(exdir, 'data', fn)), 3))) .';

f  = imload('facies1.png');
G  = computeGeometry(cartGrid(size(f)) );

ps      = compressPartition(f(:) + 1); clear f;
pu      = partitionUI(G, [4 4]);
[b,i,p] = unique([ps, pu], 'rows');
p       = processPartition(G, p);

clf,
plotCellData(G, ps);
outlineCoarseGrid(G, p, 'w');

%%
% Let us now consider the same model, but with some 'noise' added outside
% the main object, which may or may not lead to confined blocks, i.e.,
% blocks that are completely contained within another block. The confined
% blocks are marked in white color in the plot below.
f       = imload('facies2.png');
ps      = compressPartition(f(:) + 1); clear f;
[b,i,p] = unique([ps, pu], 'rows'); %#ok<*ASGLU>
p       = processPartition(G, p);
blks    = findConfinedBlocks(G, p);

clf,
plotCellData(G, ps);
outlineCoarseGrid(G, p, 'w');
for i=1:numel(blks),
   plotGrid(G,find(p==blks(i)),'FaceColor','w','edgecolor','none')
end

%%
% Such blocks should be detected and removed. If a block only has a single
% neighbour, it will have only one coarse face. This means that the block
% will effectively represent an obstacle to flow inside the domain in an
% incompressible flow simulation using net fluxes on the coarse grid.
[blks, p] = findConfinedBlocks(G, p);

clf,
plotCellData(G, ps);
outlineCoarseGrid(G, p, 'w');

%% Model with four facies
% As our next case, we consider a reservoir in which we have four
% different facies that are read from a png-image. For each facies, we
% generate a different lognormal permeability distribution.
f       = imload('facies3.png');
G       = computeGeometry(cartGrid(size(f), [500 500]));
k       = logNormLayers([size(f) 4],[800 50 200 1]);
[b,i,j] = unique(f); num=1:length(b);
facies  = num(j).';
K       = k( (1:numel(facies))' + (facies-1)*numel(facies));
rock.perm = K(:);
rock.poro = 0.2*ones(size(K));
clear f k;

clf,

plotCellData(G, facies, 'EdgeColor', 'none')
axis equal tight, title('Facies')
subplot(2,2,2)
plotCellData(G,log10(rock.perm),'EdgeColor','none')

% The facies distribution contain some speckles which one should be careful
% to get rid of as shown in the lower-right plot

p       = processPartition(G, p);
