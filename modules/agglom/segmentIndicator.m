function [partition, edges] = segmentIndicator(G, indicator, bins, varargin)
%Segments a fine grid into blocks according to indicator.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   partition = segmentIndicator(G, indicator, bins)
%   partition = segmentIndicator(G, indicator, bins, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%   [partition, edges] = segmentIndicator(...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function segments fine grid cells into prescribed bins according
%   the given indicator value (indicator).  The cell groupings may be split
%   into connected components.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G         - Grid data structure discretising the reservoir model
%               (fine grid, geological model).
%
%   indicator - Cell-wise value of some measure/indicator function.
%               Assuming positive numbers.
%
%   bins      - Gives the bins to segment the fine grid cells into if it is
%               a vector and the number of bins if a scalar.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   split    - Whether or not to split the grouped cells into connected
%              components. Default: true
%
%   verbose  - Whether or not display number of blocks in the resulting
%              partition. Default value dependent upon global verbose
%              settings of function 'mrstVerbose'.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   partition - Partition vector after segmenting all cells into blocks
%               according to the indicator
%
%   edges     - Segmentation levels.  Equal to 'bins' if a vector.
%               otherwise, in case of scalar, positive 'bins',
%
%               edges = LINSPACE(MIN(indicator), MAX(indicator), bins + 1)
