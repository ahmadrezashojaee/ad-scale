function p = mergeBlocks(p, G, IVol, IFlw, NL, varargin)
% Merge blocks in a partitioning that are smaller than the given limit.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = mergeBlocks(p, G, IVol, IFlw, NL)
%   p = mergeBlocks(p, G, IVol, IFlw, NL, ...
%                           'static_partition', p2);
%   p = mergeBLocks(p, G, IVol, IFlw, NL, ...
%                           'verbose', true);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function merges too small blocks to a neigbhoring blocks. Which
%   blocks to merge are decided by "IVol" and INTO which blocks they
%   are merged, is decided by "IFlw".
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   p     - Partition vector
%
%   G     - Grid data structure discretising the reservoir model
%           (fine grid, geological model).
%
%   IVol  - Cell-wise value of some measure/indicator function used for
%           deciding which blocks to merge.
%
%   IFlw  - Cell-wise value of some measure/indicator function used for
%           deciding which neighboring block to merge into.
%
%   NL    - Algorithm controlling parameter. The algorithm will merge
%           blocks that violate the criterion
%
%                 IVol(B) |B| >= (NL / n) IVol(G) |G|    (*)
%
%           with the neighboring block that has the closest IFlw value.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   verbose - Whether or not display number of blocks in the resulting
%           partition. Default value dependent on the global verbose
%           settings of function 'mrstVerbose'.
%
%   static_partition - A partitioning that should be preserved throughout
%           the merging.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p     - Partition vector after merging.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `segmentPartition`, `refineBlocks`
