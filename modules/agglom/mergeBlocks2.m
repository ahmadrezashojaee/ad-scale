function p = mergeBlocks2(p, G, IVol, IFlw, NL, NU, varargin)
%Alternative implementation of Amalgamation 'MERGE' primitive
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   p = mergeBlocks2(p, G, IVol, IFlw, NL, NU)
%   p = mergeBlocks2(p, G, IVol, IFlw, NL, NU, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   p      - Partition vector.  Possibly created by function
%            'segmentIndicator' or some other partitioning algorithm.  The
%            input partition vector should not contain any disconnected
%            blocks.  Function 'processPartition' will split such blocks.
%
%   G      - Grid structure.
%
%   IVol   - Block volume indicator.  One non-negative scalar, interpreted
%            as a density, for each cell in the grid 'G'.
%
%   IFlw   - Block flow indicator.  One non-negative scalar, interpreted as
%            a density, for each cell in the grid 'G'.  The algorithm will
%            merge a candidate block to its (feasible) neighbouring block
%            that most closely matches its own block flow.
%
%   NL, NU - Algorithm controlling parameters.  The algorithm will merge
%            blocks that violate the criterion
%
%                IVol(B) |B| >= (NL / n) IVol(G) |G|    (*)
%
%            while simultaneously attempting to uphold the upper bound flow
%            criterion
%
%                IFlw(B) |B| <= (NU / n) IFlw(G) |G|    (**)
%
%            Optionally, we may also try to uphold an upper bound on the
%            number of cells in each block
%
%                #cells(B) <= NB                        (***)
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   nblock   - Upper bound on the number of cells in a single block.
%              Default: nblock = inf
%
%   cfac     - A relative factor at which the upper bound(s) are turned
%              into hard constraints. Default: cfac = inf
%
% RETURNS:
%   p      - Updated partition vector.  Typically contains fewer blocks
%            than the input partition vector.  None of the resulting blocks
%            should violate the criterion (*), but some of the blocks may
%            violate the criteria (**) and (***).

%   `mergeBlocks`, `refineBlocks`, `processPartition`.
