%% Example 1: Cartesian Grid with Anistropic Permeability
% The multipoint flux-approximation (MPFA-O) method is developed to be
% consistent on grids that are not K-orthogonal. In this example, we
% introduce how to use the method by applying it to a problem with
% anisotropic permeability. For comparison, we also compute solutions with
% two other methods: (i) the two-point flux-approximation (TFPA) method,
% which is not consistent and only convergent on K-orthogonal grids; and
% the mimetic finite-difference (MFD) method, which is consistent and
% applicable to general polyhedral grids. For the MFD method, we will use
% an inner product that simplifies to a two-point method on K-orthogonal
% grids.
%
%
% To compare the methods, we consider the single-phase pressure equation
%
% $$\nabla\cdot v = q, \qquad v=\textbf{--}\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p,$$
%
% for a two-dimensional Cartesian grid with anisotropic, homogeneous
% permeability which will violate the K-orthogonality condition. To drive
% the flow, we impose a single well and zero Dirichlet boundary conditions.
%
%
% The main idea of the TPFA method is to approximate the flux v over a face
% f by the difference of the cell centered pressures in the neighboring
% cells (sharing the face f) weigthed by a face transmissibility T:
%
% $$ v_{ij} = T_{ij}(p_i \textbf{--} p_j).$$
%
% The pressure in each cell is approximated by solving a linear system
% Ap = b. When ignoring wells, sources, and bc, A and b are given by
%
% $$ a_{ik} = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
%              \sum_j t_{ij}  & \textrm{if } i=k, \\
%              -t_{ij} &  \textrm{if }\, i\neq k,
%              \end{array} \right. \quad
%              \textrm{and} \quad b_i = \int_{i} q \, dx. $$
%
% Once the pressure is known, the flux is calculated using the expression
% given above.
%
% In the same manner, the MPFA method approximates the flux v over a face f
% as a linear combination of the cell pressure and cell pressures in
% neighbor cells sharing at least one vertex with the face f.
%
% The mimetic method approximates the face flux as a linear combination of
% cell pressures and face pressures.  Only in special cases is it possible
% to make a local stencil for the face flux in terms of cell pressures,
% while the stencil for the flux in terms of face pressures is always local.
%
% In this example we show non-monotone solutions to the pressure equation
% that arise from both the MPFA-method and the Mimetic method.

%% Define and process geometry
% Construct a Cartesian grid of size 10-by-10-by-4 cells, where each cell
% has dimension 1-by-1-by-1. Because our flow solvers are applicable for
% general unstructured grids, the Cartesian grid is here represented using
% an unstructured formate in which cells, faces, nodes, etc. are given
% explicitly.
nx = 11; ny = 11;
G = cartGrid([nx, ny]);
G = computeGeometry(G);

%% Set rock and fluid data
% The only parameters in the single-phase pressure equation are the
% permeability $K$, which here is homogeneous, isotropic and equal 100 mD.
% The fluid has density 1000 kg/m^3 and viscosity 1 cP.
% We make a non diagonal rock tensor
theta=30*pi/180;
U = [cos(theta),sin(theta);-sin(theta),cos(theta)];
rocktensor = U'*diag([0.1,10])*U;
rocktensor = [rocktensor(1,1),rocktensor(1,2),rocktensor(2,2)];
rock = makeRock(G, rocktensor .* 1e-3*darcy, 1);
fluid = initSingleFluid('mu' , 1*centi*poise , ...
                        'rho', 1014*kilogram/meter^3);

%% Introduce wells
% We will include two wells, one rate-controlled vertical well and one
% horizontal well controlled by bottom-hole pressure. Wells are described
% using a Peacemann model, giving an extra set of equations that need to be
% assembled. We need to specify ('InnerProduct', 'ip_tpf') to get the
% correct well model for TPFA.
%
% The first well is vertical well (vertical is default):
%
% * completion in cells: cellsWell1
% * controlled by production rate = 1.0  [m^3/d]
% * radius = 0.1.                        [m]
%
cellsWell1 =  sub2ind(G.cartDims,floor(nx/2)+1,floor(ny/2)+1);
radius     = .1;
% well with wellindex calculated for TPFA
bhp=1;
W = addWell([], G, rock, cellsWell1, 'Comp_i', 1, ...
            'Type', 'bhp', 'Val', bhp*barsa(),    ...
            'Radius', radius, 'InnerProduct', 'ip_tpf');
% well with wellindex calculated for MIMETIC
W_mim = addWell([], G, rock, cellsWell1, 'Comp_i', 1, ...
            'Type', 'bhp', 'Val', bhp*barsa(),        ...
            'Radius', radius, 'InnerProduct', 'ip_simple');

%%
%  The second well is horizontal in the 'y' direction:
%
% * completion in cells: cellsWell2
% * controlled by bottom hole pressure, bhp = 1e5 [Pa]
% * radius = 0.1                                  [m]
%

%% Impose Dirichlet boundary conditions
% Our flow solvers automatically assume no-flow conditions on all outer
% (and inner) boundaries; other type of boundary conditions need to be
% specified explicitly.
%
% Here, we impose Neumann conditions (flux of 1 m^3/day) on the global
% left-hand side. The fluxes must be given in units of m^3/s, and thus we
% need to divide by the number of seconds in a day (<matlab:help('day')
% day()>).  Similarly, we set Dirichlet boundary conditions p = 0 on the
% global right-hand side of the grid, respectively. For a single-phase
% flow, we need not specify the saturation at inflow boundaries. Similarly,
% fluid composition over outflow faces (here, right) is ignored by pside.
bc = pside([], G, 'LEFT',  0);
bc = pside(bc, G, 'RIGHT', 0);
bc = pside(bc, G, 'BACK', 0);
bc = pside(bc, G, 'FRONT', 0);

%% APPROACH 1: Direct/Classic TPFA
% Initialize solution structure with reservoir pressure equal 0. Compute
% one-sided transmissibilities for each face of the grid from input grid
% and rock properties. The harmonic averages of ones-sided
% transmissibilities are computed in the solver incompTPFA.
T = computeTrans(G, rock);

%%
% Initialize well solution structure (with correct bhp).
% No need to assemble well system (wells are added to the linear system
% inside the incompTPFA-solver).
resSol1 = initState(G, W, 0);

% Solve linear system construced from T and W to obtain solution for flow
% and pressure in the reservoir and the wells. Notice that the TPFA solver
% is different from the one used for mimetic systems.
resSol1 = incompTPFA(resSol1, G, T, fluid, 'wells', W, 'bc',bc);


%% APPROACH 2: Mimetic with TPFA-inner product
% Initialize solution structure with reservoir pressure equal 0. Compute
% the mimetic inner product from input grid and rock properties.
IP = computeMimeticIP(G, rock, 'InnerProduct', 'ip_simple');
resSol2 = initState(G, W, 0);

%% Solve mimetic linear hybrid system
resSol2 = incompMimetic(resSol2, G, IP, fluid, 'wells', W_mim, 'bc', bc);

%% APPROACH 3: MPFA method
% Compute the transmisibility matrix for mpfa
T_mpfa = computeMultiPointTrans(G, rock,'eta',1/3);
resSol3 = initState(G, W, 0);

%% Solve MPFA pressure
resSol3 = incompMPFA(resSol3, G, T_mpfa, fluid, 'wells', W,'bc',bc);
