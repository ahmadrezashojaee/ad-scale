The sequential module implements sequential solvers for the same set of equations that are implemented with a fully-implicit discretization in ad-blackoil. The solvers are based on a fractional flow formulation wherein pressure and transport are solved as separate steps. These solvers can be significantly faster than those found in ad-blackoil for many problems, especially problems where the total velocity changes slowly during the simulation.
