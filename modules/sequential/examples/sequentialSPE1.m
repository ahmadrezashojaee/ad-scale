%% Compare sequential solver to fully implicit, applied to the SPE1 problem
% This example simulates the first SPE benchmark using both sequential and
% fully implicit solvers. The problem is a gas injection with significant
% density and mobility changes between phases, so the assumption of a
% constant total velocity for the sequential scheme is violated, and there
% are differences in production profiles between the two schemes. We also
% test a third approach, wherein the sequential scheme revisits the
% pressure solution if the mobilities change significantly, in order to
% convergence to the fully implicit solution.

%% Set up the initial simulation model
% We use the existing setupSPE1 routine to handle the setup of all
% parameters, which are then converted into a fully implicit model and a
% schedule.
[G, rock, fluid, deck, state] = setupSPE1();

model = selectModelFromDeck(G, rock, fluid, deck);
schedule = convertDeckScheduleToMRST(model, deck);

%% Run the entire fully implicit schedule
% We simulate the schedule with a fully implicit scheme, i.e. where we
% solve for both saturations and pressure simultanously.
[wsFIMP, statesFIMP, repFIMP] = simulateScheduleAD(state, model, schedule);

%% Set up and simulate the schedule using a sequential implicit scheme
% We convert the fully implicit model into a sequential model, a special
% model which contains submodels for both the pressure and transport. In
% this scheme, we first solve the pressure equation implicitly to obtain
% total volumetric fluxes at reservoir conditions, as well as total well
% rates. The pressure and fluxes are subsequently used as input for the
% transport scheme, which advects the saturations in the total velocity
% field using a fractional flow formulation.

seqModel = getSequentialModelFromFI(model);
[wsSeq, statesSeq, repSeq] = simulateScheduleAD(state, seqModel, schedule);

%% Simulate the schedule with the outer loop option enabled
% In the sequential implicit scheme, the transport equations are derived by
% assuming a fixed total velocity. For certain problems, this assumption is
% not reasonable, and the total velocity may be strongly coupled to the
% changes in saturation during a timestep. In this case, the problem is a
% gas injection scenario where the injected gas has a much higher mobility
% and much lower density, leading to significantly different results
% between the fully implicit and the sequential implicit schemes.
%
% One way to improve the results of the sequential implicit scheme is to
% employ an outer loop when needed. This amounts to revisiting the pressure
% equation after the transport has converged and checking if the pressure
% equation is still converged after the saturations have changed. If the
% pressure equation has a large residual after the transport, we then
% resolve the pressure with the new estimates for saturations.

% Make a copy of the model
seqModelOuter = seqModel;
% Disable the "stepFunctionIsLinear" option, which tells the
% NonLinearSolver that it is not sufficient to do a single pressure,
% transport step to obtain convergence. We set ds tolerance to 0.001
% (which is also the default) which is roughly equivalent to the maximum
% saturation error convergence criterion used in the fully implicit solver.
seqModelOuter.stepFunctionIsLinear = false;
seqModelOuter.incTolSaturation = 1.0000e-03;


[wsOuter, statesOuter, repOuter] = simulateScheduleAD(state, seqModelOuter, schedule);

%% Plot the results
% We plot the results for the three different temporal discretization
% schemes. Since the water is close to immobile and the injector and
% producers are operated on gas and oil rates respectively, we plot the gas
% production and the bottom hole pressure for each well.
%
% We clearly see that there are substantial differences in the well curves
% due the changes in total velocity. The sequential implicit scheme with
% the outer loop enabled is very close to the fully implicit solution and
% will get closer if the tolerances are tightened.
