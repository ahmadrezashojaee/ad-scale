%   addCoarseCenterPoints            - Adds center points to each block. A center is typically the fine cell
%   changeCoarseCenterToWellLocation - Designates coarse nodes to cells containing wells. For coarse blocks with
%   controlVolumeRestriction         - Control volume restriction operator for a given coarsegrid partition.
%   eliminateWellEquations           - Eliminate well equations from linear system
%   formReconstructionMatrix         - Form matrix for multiscale flux reconstruction
%   getCellNeighbors                 - List of cell neighbors for a single cell.
%   getEnclosingCellsByFace          - Get cells enclosing a set of points using dot product with center-face
%   getIncomp1PhMatrix               - Get TPFA-like incompressible system matrix via incompTPFA.
%   getSystemIncompTPFA              - Extract linear system from two point solver without solving any linear
%   mapCenters                       - Map fine cells as centers of coarse cells and faces.
%   reconstructPressure              - Solve reconstruction problem for multiscale methods
%   recoverWellSolution              - Recover previously eliminated well equations from solved system
%   setCentersByWells                - Small utility to set centers of coarse blocks to one of the well cells.
