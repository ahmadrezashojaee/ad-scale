function CG = storeInteractionRegionCart(CG, varargin)
% Store MPFA-like interaction region for coarse grid made from logical partitioning.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   CG = storeInteractionRegionCart(CG)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function quickly computes the interaction regions based on logical
%   indices for a coarse grid. The interaction region for a given coarse
%   block I is defined as any cells within the convex hull of the coarse
%   centroids from the nodal neighbors of I. This version relies on logical
%   indices for speed, but it is not applicable for general grids.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   CG - Coarse grid.
%
% RETURNS:
%   CG - Coarse grid with added field "CG.cells.interaction", which is a
%        cell array of length equal to CG.cells.num. Each entry j contains
%        a list of fine cells designated as interacting with coarse block
%        j.
