function [p_ms, report] = solveMultiscaleIteratively(A, q, p_ms, basis, getSmootherFn, tol, iterations, LinSolve, useGMRES, verbose)
%Apply iterations to a multiscale problem
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [p_ms, report] = solveMultiscaleIteratively(A, q, basis, getSmootherFn, tol, iterations, LinSolve, useGMRES)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Iteratively improve upon a solution using a multiscale preconditioner,
%   either as standalone or accelerated by GMRES.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   A,q           - Linear system and right hand side. This solver attempts
%                   to solve Ap = q.
%
%   basis         - Basis functions as given by getMultiscaleBasis.
%
%   getSmootherFn - Smoother handle from getSmootherFunction.
%
%   tol           - Tolerance for convergence. A solution x is deemed to be
%                   converged if norm(A*x -q, 2)/norm(q) <= tol.
%
%   iterations    - Maximum number of iterations to apply.
%
%   LinSolve      - (OPTIONAL) Linear solver for coarse scale system.
%
%   useGMRES      - (OPTIONAL) Boolean indicating if GMRES should be used 
%                   to accelerate the solution process. Default false.
%
% RETURNS:
%   p_ms     - Solution, either converged or stopped by max iterations.
%
%   report   - Convergence report.
