%% Unstructured fracture grid created by Matlab functions
% A somewhat advanced example, where a fracture network is gridded
% with triangles using a fairly simple approach. The flow equations are
% then discretized with both two- and multi-point flux expressions, and a
% two-phase transport problem is solved.

mrstModule add dfm incomp
% Create an initial distribution of points
N     = 20;
N1    = N;
N2    = N;
[X, Y] = meshgrid(0:1:N1, 0:1:N2);
X     = sqrt(3) / 2 * X;
Y(:,2:2:end) = Y(:,2:2:end)+0.5;
p     = [X(:), Y(:)];

% Estimate of the grid size
h = .3;

% Define endpoints of the fractures.
% If a nertex here is also contained in p, one of them should be removed to
% avoid mapping errors in the subsequent Delaunay triangulation
vertices = [ 3 1 ; 16 10 ;...
    3 15.7 ; 16 18 ;...
    15 4 ; 7 19.5  ;...
    4 5  ; 8 13  ;...
    14 15; 13 10];

% Give the constraints wrt numbering of the vertices
constraints = reshape(1 : size(vertices,1),2,[])' ;

% Assign tags to the fractures
constraints = [constraints, (1 : size(constraints,1))'];

% We create the grid by combining the intial points with points distributed
% along the fractures, and gridding the total point cloud with a Delaunay
% algorithm constrained by the fractures. Some tricks are needed to ensure
% the resulting grid has reasonable quality, these are briedly explained
% below. Also note that this strategy does not create high-quality grids,
% for that more advanced methods are needed; see for instance another
% example in the DFM module for a grid created by triangle.

% Bounding box of the domain. Needed for legacy reasons (when the point
% that eventually defines the grid is preconditioned to improve the grid
% quality, points are added to the cloud, and the box is needed to ensure
% the extra points are within the domain).
box = [0 0; N1 N2];

% Cells close the fractures should be significantly larger than the
% apertures for the hybrid DFM approximation to be reasonable. Moreover,
% points that are too close to the fractures will also produce weired
% cells. For these reasons, remove points that are close to the fractures.
% NOTE: The distance from the fractures where we remove points should be
% significantly larger than the tolerance for the fracture location defined
% next.
perimiter = h ;
p = remove_closepoints(vertices,constraints,p,perimiter);

% The quality of the grid is improved if the fractures are alowed to
% deviate somewhat from straight lines. This is of course an approximation,
% but it is in agreement with a concept of uncertainty in the fracture
% description. This parameter is more important for more advanced
% gridding algorithms than the present one. Still, reducing this value will
% make the fractures closer to straight lines
args = struct('precision',0.01);

% Add vertices in the intersection between fractures
[vertices, constraints] = removeFractureIntersections(vertices,constraints,box,args);

numOrdPt = size(p,1);

% Concatenate the prescribed points and the fracture endpoints
p  = [p ; vertices];

% Let constraints refer to the new point distribution
constraints(:,1:2) = constraints(:,1:2) + numOrdPt;

% Add points along the fractures to get reasonable grids there as well
[p, constraints, map] = partition_edges(p,constraints,0.5,box,args);

% Bookkeeping
tags = constraints(:,3);
constraints =  constraints(:,1:2);

% Now the points are defined. Create a constrained Delauny triangulation
% on the point cloud, and create the grid
delTri     = DelaunayTri(p, constraints);
G     = triangleGrid(delTri.X, delTri.Triangulation);
G = computeGeometry(G);

%% Introduce hybrid representation of fractures

G.faces.tags = zeros(G.faces.num,1);

% Recover faceNodes, and sort the nodes columnwise (for the use of ismember
% later)
faceNodes = sort(reshape(G.faces.nodes,2,[])',2);

% Use constraints from the Delaunay triangulation, in case these have been
% changed (it shouldn't happen, and will give a warning)
% Rowwise sort to prepare for using ismember
constraints = sort(delTri.Constraints,2);

% Loop over all constraints (the segments of fractures) and find the faces
% that spans the constraint.
for iter = 1 : size(constraints)
    % ismember works here since both inputs have been sorted
    fracFace = find(ismember(faceNodes,constraints(iter,:),'rows'));

    % Assign a tag to the newly found fracture face
    G.faces.tags(fracFace) = tags(iter);
end

% Apertures of all faces. Zero aperture for non-fractures
aperture = zeros(G.faces.num,1);

% Set different apertures for each
for iter = unique(tags)'
    hit = G.faces.tags == iter;
    aperture(hit) = 10^-3 * rand(1); % This choice is random in more than one way..
end

% Add hybrid cells along the fractures
G = addhybrid(G,G.faces.tags > 0,aperture);

% Plot the grid and the fracture. Note that the fracuters are not straight
% lines.

%% Compute transmissibilities with both MPFA and TPFA

% Note that there is a difference in how connections between hybrid cells
% are handled between TPFA and MPFA: Both methods discretize the
% connections in files that are separate from compute(MP)Trans, but TPFA
% gives a separate list of transmissibilities for cell-to-cell connections,
% whereas MPFA modifies the standard transmissibility matrix.
