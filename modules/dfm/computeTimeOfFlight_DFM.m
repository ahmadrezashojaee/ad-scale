% SYNOPSIS:
%    T        = computeTimeOfFlight(state, G, rock)
%    T        = computeTimeOfFlight(state, G, rock, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%   [T, A]    = computeTimeOfFlight(...)
%   [T, A, q] = computeTimeOfFlight(...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Compute time of flight by solving
%
%       \nabla路(vT) = \phi
%
%   using a first-order finite-volume method with upwind flux.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   G     - Grid structure.
%
%   rock  - Rock data structure.
%           Must contain a valid porosity field, 'rock.poro'.
%
%   state - Reservoir and well solution structure either properly
%           initialized from functions 'initResSol' and 'initWellSol'
%           respectively, or the results from a call to function
%           'solveIncompFlow'.  Must contain valid cell interface fluxes,
%           'state.flux'.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   wells - Well structure as defined by function 'addWell'.  May be empty
%           (i.e., wells = []) which is interpreted as a model without any
%           wells.
%
%   src   - Explicit source contributions as defined by function
%           'addSource'.  May be empty (i.e., src = []) which is
%           interpreted as a reservoir model without explicit sources.
%
%   bc    - Boundary condition structure as defined by function 'addBC'.
%           This structure accounts for all external boundary conditions
%           to the reservoir flow.  May be empty (i.e., bc = []) which is
%           interpreted as all external no-flow (homogeneous Neumann)
%           conditions.
%
%   'reverse' - Reverse the fluxes and rates.
%
%   'tracer'  - Cell-array of cell-index vectors for which to solve tracer
%               equation. One equation is solved for each vector with
%               tracer injected in cells given indices. Each vector adds
%               one additional RHS to the original tof-system. Output given
%               as additional columns in T.
% RETURNS:
%   T - Cell values of a piecewise constant approximation to time-of-flight
%       computed as the solution of the boundary-value problem
%
%           (*)    \nabla路(vT) = \phi
%
%       using a finite-volume scheme with single-point upwind approximation
%       to the flux.
%
%   A - Discrete left-hand side of (*), a G.cells.num-by-G.cells.num matrix
%       whose entries are
%
%           A_ij = min(F_ij, 0), and
%           A_ii = sum_j max(F_ij, 0) + max(q_i, 0),
%
%       where F_ij = -F_ji is the flux from cell i to cell j
%
%           F_ij = A_ij路n_ij路v_ij.
%
%       and n_ij is the outward-pointing normal of cell i for grid face ij.
%
%       OPTIONAL.  Only returned if specifically requested.
%
%   q - Aggregate source term contributions (per grid cell) from wells,
%       explicit sources and boundary conditions.  These are the
%       contributions referred to as 'q_i' in the definition of the matrix
%       elements, 'A_ii'.  Measured in units of m^3/s.
%
%       OPTIONAL.  Only returned if specifically requested.
