This is the Discrete Fracture Matrix module developed as an extension of MRST.

The module is devopled at the University of Bergen, and licenced under
the GNU General Public License v3.0.

The module is mainly developed by Tor Harald Sandve (at IRIS from Jan
2013), minor modifications are introduced by Eirik Keilegavlen (UoB).
Some utility files are partly written at Uni Research.

An overview of the files can be found in Content.m

To get started, see the examples subdirectory.

The performance of the hybrid discretization is described in:

Multi-Point Flux Approximation based approach for Discrete Fracture
Matrix simulation, Journal of Computational Physics, 231(9), 3784-3800,
doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2012.01.023.

Some thoughts on the implementation, and more general on discretization
on fractured media can be found in Implementation_Notes.pdf
