%% Time-of-flight
% To study how heterogeneity affects  flow patterns and define natural
% time-lines in the reservoir, it is common to study the so-called
% time-of-flight (TOF), i.e., the time it takes an imaginary particle
% released at an inflow boundary or at a perforation of an injector to
% reach a given point in the reservoir. Time-of-flight are usually
% associated with streamline methods, but can also be computed from linear
% steady-state transport equations on the form,
%
% $$v\cdot \nabla \tau = \phi. $$
%
% In this example, we will show how to compute time-of-flight from a given
% flux field.

%% Setup model
% As our model, we will use a logically Cartesian grid in which the
% node perturbed so that grid lines form curves and not lines. For
% simplicity, we assume unit permeability and porosity and use a set of
% source and sink terms to emulate a quater five-point setup.
G = cartGrid([50,50]);
G = twister(G);
G = computeGeometry(G);

src = addSource(src, G.cells.num, -sum(poreVolume(G, rock)), 'sat', 1);

%% Solve pressure equation
% Compute transmissibilities and solve pressure equation
trans  = computeTrans(G, rock);

%% Compute time-of-flight
% Once the fluxes are given, the time-of-flight equation is discretized
% with a standard upwind finite-volume method
t0 = tic;
T  = computeTimeOfFlight(xr, G, rock, 'src',src);
