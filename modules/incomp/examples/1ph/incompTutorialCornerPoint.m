%% Pressure Solver: Simple Corner-Point Grid with Linear Pressure Drop
% Herein we will solve the single-phase pressure equation
%
% $$\nabla\cdot v = q, \qquad v=\textbf{--}\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p,$$
%
% for a simple corner-point grid model with isotropic, lognormal
% permeability.
%
% The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the two-point pressure
% solver applied to a case with corner-point grids given as from an input
% stream in the industry-standard Eclipse(TM) format.

%% Generate the corner-point grid
% The corner-point grid is generated using a standard MATLAB(R) meshgrid
% which is then transformed to make sloping pillars and wavy layers. The
% corner-point grid is represented as a GRDECL structure, which is the same
% structure as is returned from readGRDECL.  If an extra parameter is
% passed to the simpleGrdecl function, it adds a fault to the model. 
nc = [20, 20, 5];
grdecl = simpleGrdecl(nc);        % No fault in model

%%
% Then we process the GRDECL structure and build up an unstructured grid.
G = processGRDECL(grdecl); clear grdecl

%%
% After the grid structure is generated, we plot the geometry.

%% Compute geometry information
% Having set up the basic structure, we continue to compute centroids and
% volumes of the cells and centroids, normals, and areas for the faces.
G = computeGeometry(G, 'Verbose', true);


%% Make rock and fluid data
% We generate a lognormal and layered permeability and specify that we are
% working with a single-phase fluid; type <matlab:helpt('initSingleFluid')
% "help initSingleFluid"> to see default values for density and viscosity.
% Our flow solver is constructed for a general incompressible flow and thus
% requires the evaluation of a total mobility function, which in our case
% equals one in the whole domain.
perm = convertFrom(logNormLayers(nc, [100, 400, 50]), milli*darcy());
rock = makeRock(G, perm, 1);
fluid     = initSingleFluid('mu' ,    1*centi*poise     , ...
                            'rho', 1014*kilogram/meter^3);

% Plot the logarithm of the layered permeability.

%% Add boundary conditions
% Pressure is set of one bar on the west-side boundary and zero on the
% east-side boundary.  No-flow conditions are imposed automatically at all
% other (outer) boundaries.
westFaces = find(G.faces.centroids(:,1) == 0);
bc = addBC([], westFaces, 'pressure',        ...
           repmat(1*barsa(), [numel(westFaces), 1]));

xMax = max(G.faces.centroids(:,1));
eastFaces = find(G.faces.centroids(:,1) == xMax);
bc = addBC(bc, eastFaces, 'pressure',        ...
           zeros(numel(eastFaces), 1));

% Then we plot the grid, coloring the faces on which we have imposed
% boundary conditions.

%%  Assemble and solve system
% Finally, we compute transmissibilities, construct two-point
% discretization and solve the corresponding linear equations.

% We plot the results: cell pressure is converted to unit 'bar' and fluxes
% to unit m^3/day when plotting results.
