function [v_darcy, neighbors, ...
         normals, up_inx, g_vec] = initFaceMob(G, resSol, flux, grav)
%Initialize upwind face mobility saturation indices according to Darcy flux.
%That is, face mobility when not considering gravity.  Output is used by
%function findFaceMobMat.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [v_darcy,   ...
%    neighbors, ...
%    normals,   ...
%    up_inx, g_vec] = initFaceMob(G, resSol, flux, grav)
%
%   G       - Grid data structure discretising the reservoir model.
%
%   resSol  - Reservoir solution structure containing valid (water)
%             saturation resSol.s(:,1) with one value for each cell in the
%             grid.
%
%   flux    - Inflow matrix of fluxes into each cell, created
%             by function initTransport.  Size
%             G.cells.num-by-(G.faces.num-#(boundary faces)). The fluxes
%             are assumed to be measured in units of m^3/s.
%
%   grav    - Matrix with gravity contribution for each face, created by
%             function initTransport.  Same size as flux.
%
% RETURNS:
%   v_darcy   - Darcy flux for internal faces.
%
%   neighbors - Neighbours for internal faces.
%
%   normals   - Vector of face normals for internal faces.
%
%   up_inx    - Index of cells for initial upwind face mobility.
%               Size = #(internal faces).
%
%   g_vec     - Gravity contributions = abs[K(rho_1-rho_2)*g*n_z],
%               for each face, where n_z is the z-component of the normal.
