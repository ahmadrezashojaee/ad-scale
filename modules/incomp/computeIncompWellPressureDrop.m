function dp = computeIncompWellPressureDrop(W, mob, rho, g)
%Compute incompressible connection pressure drop for a single well
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   dp = computeIncompWellPressureDrop(W, mob, rho, g)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   W   - Well structure as defined by function addWell.
%
%   mob - Phase mobilities for each cell in model.
%
%   rho - Fluid mass densities.  One scalar for each fluid phase.
%
%   g   - Norm of gravity along z-axis
%
% RETURNS:
%   dp - Column vector of size numel(W.cells).  Contains each completion's
%        pressure drop along the well bore from the bottom hole pressure
%        reference depth, under certain assumptions for the incompressible,
%        linear pressure equation.
%
% NOTES:
%   In order to avoid nonlinear behavior for wells, this function assumes
%   that the well bore density is constant for all perforations and is
%   equal to the injection composition if the well is an injector,
%   either through positive rates or W.sign > 0. If the well is a producer,
%   the mixture is assumed to be taken from the perforated cells, with flux
%   proportional to the well indices.
