classdef NatVarsShaleModel < NaturalVariablesCompositionalModel
    % Natural variables model for compositional problems
    %
    % SYNOPSIS:
    %   model = NaturalVariablesCompositionalModel(G, rock, fluid, compFluid)
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   The natural variables model relies on separate primary variables
    %   for saturations in the multiphase region. This makes it possible to
    %   perform certain heuristics to ensure convergence (e.g. saturation
    %   chopping) since there is a weaker correspondence between
    %   saturations and the compositions. However, this formulation
    %   traverses the phase boundary as a number of discrete steps and can
    %   take more nonlinear iterations for some problems.
    %
    % PARAMETERS:
    %   G         - Grid structure
    %   rock      - Rock structure for the reservoir
    %   fluid     - The flow fluid, containing relative permeabilities,
    %               surface densities and flow properties for the
    %               aqueous/water phase (if present)
    %   compFluid - CompositionalMixture instance describing the species
    %               present.
    %
    % RETURNS:
    %  model - Initialized class instance
    %
