%% Streamlines for a 2D Quater Five-Spot Well Pattern
% The quarter five-spot problem is one of the cases that are most widely
% used to test numerical methods. The setup consist of an injector and a
% producer located in diagonally oposite corners, with no-flow conditions
% along the model perimeter. This gives a symmetric flow pattern with high
% flow along the diagonal and stagnant points at the corners with no wells.

mrstModule add mimetic incomp streamlines

%% Construct model and compute flow field
G = cartGrid([25,25]);
G = computeGeometry(G);

rock = makeRock(G, 10*milli*darcy, 0.3);

fluid = initSimpleFluid('mu',  [1, 1]*centi*poise', ...
                        'rho', [1000, 1000]*kilogram/meter^3, ...
                        'n',   [2, 2]);

T = computeTrans(G, rock);
src = addSource([], [1, G.cells.num], [1.1, -1.1]);

x = initResSol(G, 0, 0);
x = incompTPFA(x, G, T, fluid, 'src', src);

%% Trace streamlines
% Pick start points on the diagonal orthogonal to the well-pair direction
% and trace streamlines forward and backward from these points. This will
% ensure maximal accuracy in the near-well regions where the streamlines
% are converging.
