%% Compare Time-of-Flight Computed by Steamlines and by Finite-Volumes
% MRST offers two ways of computing time-of-flight for Cartesian grids:
% 
% * using Pollock tracing from the |streamlines| module
% * using finite-volume methods from the |diagnostics| module
% 
% Pollock's method gives pointwise values of high accuracy for Cartesian
% grids, but this method has not yet been implemented for general
% unstructured grids. The finite-volume method computes time-of-flight in a
% volume-averaged sense, and will hence not have high pointwise accuracy,
% but can readily be applied to any type of valid MRST grid.
mrstModule add mimetic incomp diagnostics streamlines

%% Setup model and solve flow problem
% We consider a 60x60 grid with a quarter five-spot well pattern. The
% petrophysical quantities can either be uniform, or sampled from a
% Gaussian distribution. Pollock's method is not yet implemented for
% non-unit porosity values, but this minor deficiency can be circumvented
% by appropriate postprocessing and scaling of cell increments
