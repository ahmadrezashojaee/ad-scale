function [yi, dyidxi] = interpReg(T, xi, reginx)
%Interpolate data (with region support)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [yi, dyidxi] = interpReg(T, xi, reginx)
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   T      - Interpolation table. Cell array of N tables for interpolation
%            where N is the number of regions. Table should consist of a
%            function f(x) in the format [x, f(x)] where x are points and 
%            f(x) is the function values, both in the format of column
%            vectors.
%
%   xi     - Query points where the function should be interpolated.
%
%   reginx - Cell array of length N, where each entry corresponds to a list
%            of the cells present in a certain region. See getRegMap for
%            details.
%
% RETURNS:
%   yi     - Function evaluated at given points, accounting for regions.
%
%   dyidxi - Slope at xi (only computed if requested).
