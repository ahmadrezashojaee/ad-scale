%% Flow Pattern and Dynamic Heterogeneity for 2D Five-Spot Problem
% In this example we will demonstrate how we can use time-of-flight and
% stationary tracer distribution computed using a standard finite-volume
% method to visualize flow patterns and compute three different measures
% for dynamic heterogeneity:
%
% # flow-capacity/storage-capacity diagram,
% # the Lorenz coefficient
% # sweep efficiency
%
mrstModule add diagnostics spe10 incomp

%% Set up and solve flow problem
% As our example, we consider a standard five spot with heterogeneity
% sampled from Model 2 of the 10th SPE Comparative Solution Project.
[G, W, rock] = getSPE10setup(25);
rock.poro = max(rock.poro, 1e-4);
fluid = initSingleFluid('mu', 1*centi*poise, 'rho', 1014*kilogram/meter^3);
rS = initState(G, W, 0);
T  = computeTrans(G, rock);
rS = incompTPFA(rS, G, T, fluid, 'wells', W);

%% Compute and display time-of-flight and tracer partitioning
% First we compute time-of-flight which is the travel time from an injector
% to a given point in the reservoir, and stationary distribution of tracers
% injected continuously from each injetion well. From the latter, we can
% easily compute the volume flooded by each injector. Reversing the
% velocity field, we can cmopute the reverse time-of-flight (the travel
% time from an arbitrary point to the nearest producer) and the drainage
% volumes of each producer.
pargs = {'EdgeColor','none'};
D = computeTOFandTracer(rS, G, rock, 'wells', W);
subplot(1,2,1); plotCellData(G,D.ppart,pargs{:}); axis equal tight
subplot(1,2,2); plotCellData(G,log10(sum(D.tof,2)),pargs{:}); axis equal tight

%% Compute and display flow-capacity/storage-capacity diagram
% Making an analogue to 1D displacement theory, the F-Phi curve is the
% equivalent to a plot of the fractional flow versus saturation.
[F,Phi] = computeFandPhi(poreVolume(G,rock),D.tof);
figure, plot(Phi,F,'.');

%% Compute the Lorenz coefficient
% The Lorenz coefficient is a popular measure of heterogeneity. It is equal
% to twice the area under the curve and above the F=Phi line. It varies
% between 0 (homogeneous displacement) to 1 (infinitely heterogeneous
% displacement).
fprintf(1, 'Lorenz coefficient: %f\n', computeLorenz(F,Phi));

%% Compute and display sweep efficiency versus dimensionless time
% Analogue: 1D displacement using the F-Phi curve as a flux function
[Ev,tD] = computeSweep(F,Phi);
