% This example launches the (limited robustness) TrajectoryGUI for the Egg 
% model. The GUI enables drawing and draging around well-trajectories which 
% can be saves as an MRST well structues. Diagnostics for the newly created 
% wells can be investigated by launcing the DiagnosticsViewer. 
% 
% INSTRUCTIONS
%
% To create a new well:
% * press "New"
% * right-click inside left-side axis for drawing options ("along line" is recommend). 
% * This enables you to draw the horizontal path of the well. Use left-click on the points 
%   to move them, add additional points by left-clicking where you want new points, and 
%   right-click on the points to delete.
% * On the right-hand axis you now see a vertical cross section along the horizontal path 
%   from the left-hand axis. To draw the path of the well onto this cross section , 
%   right-click in the right-hand axis and choose "Draw points -> along line".
%
% To view the well(s):
% * When you have drawn both a horizontal and cross-sectional well path, you can press the 
%   "View" button to get a 3D view of the well(s) with the traversered grid cells.
%
% Configure and save well:
% * Specify our well parameters by selecting Type, Control and Value
% * Save your new well by pressing the "Save" button. It now appears in the topmost dropdown list
% 
% Launch diagnostics:
% * When you are happy with your well(s) and have saved them, launch diagnostics by pressing the 
%   "Launch diagnostics" button.
