function [p, s] = samplePiecewiseLinear(f, sInit, tolAbs)
% Utility to linearize smooth parametric curve f(s)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [p, s] = samplePiecewiseLinear(f, sInit, tolAbs)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function picks points {s_i} along the curve segment 
%       f(s), sInit(1) <= s <= sInit(end)
%   such that for each output parameter interval [s_i, s_{i+1}] the distance 
%   from the line segment between f(s_i) and f(s_{i+1})) to the
%   corresponding curve segment is smaller that tolAbs. 
%   
%   The above requirement is ignored whenever norm( f(s_{i+1})-f(s_i) ) < tolAbs
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   f       - function handle for f:R -> R^n.
%   sInit   - Initial set of parameter values, must at least contain two
%             elements such that sInit(1) is minimal and sInit(end) is maximal 
%             paramter value. Any other values (1<i<end) is used as initial 
%             linearisation, i.e., s -> interp(sInit, f(sInit), s)
%   tolAbs  - Absolute tollerance, see description above 
%
% RETURNS:
%   p - points along the curve
%   s - parameters sich that p = f(s)
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   [p, s] = samplePiecewiseLinear(@(t)[t.*cos(t), t.*sin(t)], [0 4*pi], 0.1)
%   plot(p(:,1), p(:,2), 'o-')
