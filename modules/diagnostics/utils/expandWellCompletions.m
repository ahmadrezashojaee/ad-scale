function [xc,Wc]=expandWellCompletions(state, W, expansion, split)
%Pseudo-wells for computation of flow diagnostics for completions
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [xn, Wn] = expandWellCompletions(x, W, c)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The routines in the flow diagnostic module compute time-of-flight,
%   tracer partition, and well-pair information associated with the whole
%   completion set of each individual well. To compute flow diagnostics for
%   subsets of the well completion, the corresponding well must be replaced
%   by a set of pseudo wells, one for each desired completion interval.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   x - Reservoir and well solution structure either properly
%       initialized from functions 'initResSol' and 'initWellSol',
%       respectively, or the results from a call to function
%       'solveIncompFlow'.  Must contain valid cell interface fluxes,
%       'state.flux'.
%
%   W - Well structure as defined by function 'addWell'.
%
%   expansion - Either of two alternatives:
%
%     a)
%       nx2 vector that specifies how to expand individual wells into a
%       set of pseudo wells. That is, the completions of well number
%       c(i,1) are assigned to c(i,2) bins using a load-balanced
%       linear distribution and then the well is replaced with c(i,2)
%       pseudo wells, one for each bin of completions.
%
%     b)
%       Cell array of length n. Entry number i in this cell array should be
%       the same length as W(i).cells and contain the bins that will be
%       used to expand the well.
%
% RETURNS:
%   Wn  - Well structure containing the pseudo wells
%
%   xn  - Reservoir and solution structure corresponding
%
