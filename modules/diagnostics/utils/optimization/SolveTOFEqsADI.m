function D = SolveTOFEqsADI(eqs, state, W, computeTracer, linsolve)
%Solve the time of flight equations for solveStationaryPressure.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%  D = SolveTOFEqsADI(eqs, state, W, true)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Solves tof/tracer problems efficiently for solveStationaryPressure.
%   This function is primarily meant to be called from other functions and
%   the interface reflects this. For a more general time of flight solver,
%   see computeTOFandTracer.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%
%   eqs   - Residual equations for pressure, time of flight and tracer.
%
%   state - Reservoir state
%
%   W     - The wells for which tracers are to be computed.
%
%   computeTracer - Boolean indicating if tracers are required.
%
% RETURNS:
%   D     - Time of flight / tracer structure.
