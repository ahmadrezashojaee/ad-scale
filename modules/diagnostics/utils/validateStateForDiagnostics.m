function state = validateStateForDiagnostics(state)
%Validate and fix state for flow diagnostics
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   state = validateStateForDiagnostics(state)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Routine for ensuring that states are suitable for diagnostic routines.
%   Not all solvers produce the "flux" fields directly, but may instead
%   give component fluxes that must be combined to form the flux. This
%   routine will, if possible, ensure that flux exists in the state.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   state - State produced by one of MRST's solvers.
%
% RETURNS:
%   state - State with flux at wellSol and interfaces, if possible.
%
% NOTE:
%   This routine will throw an error if there is insufficient data to
%   produce the correct fields.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `computeTOFandTracer`.
