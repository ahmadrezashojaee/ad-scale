function Lc = computeLorenz(F,Phi)
%Compute the Lorenz coefficient
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   Lc = computeLorenz(F, Phi)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   F   - flow capacity
%   Phi - storage capacity
%
% RETURNS:
%   Lc  - the Lorenz coefficient, a popular measure of heterogeneity. It is
%         equal to twice the area under the curve and above the F=Phi line.
%         It varies between 0 (homogeneous displacement) to 1 (infinitely
%         heterogeneous displacement).
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `computeFandPhi`, `computeSweep`
