function [exc, eWC] = expandCoarseWellCompletions(xc, WC, Wdf, p)
%Pseudo-wells for computing flow diagnostics in an upscaled model
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [xn, Wn] = expandCoarseWellCompletions(xc, Wc, Wdf, p)
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   xc  - Reservoir and well solution structure either properly
%         initialized from functions 'initResSol' and 'initWellSol',
%         respectively, or the results from a call to function
%         'solveIncompFlow'.  Must contain valid cell interface fluxes,
%         'state.flux'.
%
%   Wc  - Well structure as defined by function 'addWell'.
%
%   Wdf - Expanded well structure used for flow diagnostics computation in
%         the underlying fine-scale model, typically the result of a call
%         to 'expandWellCompletions'.
%
%   p   - partition vector describing the coarse-scale partition (i.e., the
%         mapping from the fine grid to the coarse grid)
%
% RETURNS:
%   Wn  - Well structure containing the pseudo wells
%
%   xn  - Reservoir and solution structure corresponding
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `expandWellCompletions`, `computeTOFandTracer`, `computeWellPairs`
