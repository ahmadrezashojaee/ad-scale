function [Ev,tD] = computeSweep(F,Phi)
%Compute sweep efficiency versus dimensionless time (PVI)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [Ev,tD] = computeSweep(F, Phi)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   F   - flow capacity
%   Phi - storage capacity
%
% RETURNS:
%   tD  - dimensionless time (PVI)
%   Ev  - sweep efficiency. Analogue: 1D displacement using the F-Phi curve
%         as flux funcion
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `computeFandPhi`, `computeLorenz`
