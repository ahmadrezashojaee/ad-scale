function [F,Phi] = computeFandPhi(arg1, varargin)
%Compute flow-capacity/storage-capacity diagram (F,Phi)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [F,Phi] = computeFandPhi(pv, tof)
%   [F,Phi] = computeFandPhi(rtd)
%   [F,Phi] = computeFandPhi(rtd, 'sum', true/false);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Compute the flow-capacity/storage-capacity based upon either:
%    1. Pore volumes and time-of-flight values per cell. In this case,
%       Phi is defined as the cumulative pore volume and F is the
%       cumulative flux as function of residence time. Assuming
%       incompressible flow, the instant flux is computed as the ratio of
%       pore volume and the residence time.
%    2. Residence-time distribution. In this case, F is the integral of the
%       RTD values, whereas Phi is the first-order moment (i.e., the
%       integral of the product of time and RTD values).
%   Making an analogue to 1D displacement theory, the F-Phi curve is the
%   equivalent to a plot of the fractional flow versus saturation.
%   Technical description: see Section 13.2-13.3 in the MRST book, Shavali
%   et al. (SPE 146446), and Shook and Mitchell (SPE 124625)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   vol - pore volume, one value per cell
%   tof - two-component vector with time-of-flight from injector and
%         time-of-flight from producer, one value per cell
%   rtd - structure with residence-time distribution from computeRTD
%
% RETURNS:
%   F   - flow capacity = cumulative flux for increasing time-of-flight
%         values, where the flux per cell is defined from the relation
%                volume = flux * total_travel_time
%   Phi - storage capacity = cumulative pore volume for increasing
%         time-of-flight values
