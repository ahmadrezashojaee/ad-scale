function selection = selectTOFRegion(D, max_tof, min_tof, varargin)
%Select a subset of cells based on TOF criteria
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   selectTOFRegion(D, max_tof, min_tof, ...);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Selects a subset of a grid based on TOF information and selection
%   criteria.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%
%   D - Time of flight object computed by computeTOFandTracer.
%   max_tof - All TOF-regions higher than this will be discarded.
%   min_tof - All TOF-regions less than this will be discarded.
%
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%       'drain_wells' - List of draining (production) wells to consider.
%                       Other wells will be ignored
%       'flood_wells' - List of flooding (injecting) wells to consider.
%                       Other wells will be ignored
%       'set_op'	  - Operation op to perform, so that the computed
%                       selection is op(flood, drain) where flood and drain
%                       are the flooding and drainage volumes,
%                       respectively.
%       'near_well_max_tof' - Threshold for near well regions to include.
%                             Set to zero to disable including near-well
%                             regions.
%       'psubset' - User specified draining / production region to
%                   consider. When this is enabled, max_tof and min_tof
%                   will not be used to find the selected drainage region.
%       'isubset' - User specified flooding / injection region to consider.
%                   When this is enabled, max_tof and min_tof will not be
%                   used to find the selected flooding region.
%       'tracer_threshold' - Tracer-value threshold for including in
%                   region. For 'intersection', threshold applies to product 
%                   of inj/prod tracers. Default value: 0.05;
%
% RETURNS:
%
%   A list of cell indices
