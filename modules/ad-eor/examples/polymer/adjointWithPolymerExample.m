%% Computation of Adjoints for Polymer and Waterflooding
% In this example, we demonstrate how one can use an adjoint simulation to
% compute gradients (sensitivities). To illustrate this, we compare water
% and polymer flooding in a simple box-shaped reservoir represented on a
% uniform 31×31×3 Cartesian grid with homogeneous rock properties. The well
% pattern consists of a producer in the center of the reservoir and two
% injectors in the northeast and southwest corners; all wells are completed
% in the top layer. Somewhat unrealistic, the well schedule consists of a
% period of injection with polymer, followed by a water flooding phase
% without polymer. Finally, the water rate is reduced for the final time
% steps. For comparison, we also simulate a case with pure waterflooding.
%
% The implementation and computational strategy used to obtain adjoints is
% independent of the actual system considered and a similar approach can be
% used for other systems and setups with minor (and obvious) modifications.

%% Set up initial reservoir state

%% Plot polymer properties
% In the basic setup, water is much more mobile than the oil we are trying
% to displace, and as a result, a pure waterflooding will not be very
% efficient. To improve the oil recovery, we will add polymer to the
% injected water phase. This will increase the viscosity of the water
% phase and hence make the water much less mobile, which in turn will
% increase the local displacement efficiency and also the volumetric sweep.
% To see the effect of polymer on the water viscosity, we plot the visocity
% multiplier, which is based on tabulated data given in the input file

%% Set up systems
% To quantify the effect of adding the polymer to the injected water, we
% will solve the same system both with and without polymer. This is done by
% creating an Oil/Water/Polymer system and an Oil/Water system. Note that
% since the data file already contains polymer as an active phase, we do not
% need to pass initADISystem anything other than the deck.

%% Run the schedule
% Once a model has been created it is trivial to run the schedule. Any
% options such as maximum non-linear iterations and tolerance can be set in
% the model and the NonLinearSolver class (optional argument to
% simulateScheduleAD).

%% Plot accumulated present value
% The objective function is now the net present value of the reservoir at
% each time step, i.e. the cost of doing that timestep. However, the most
% interesting value is here the accumulated net present value, as it will
% show us the profit over the lifetime of the reservoir. We plot the three
% different polymer costs, as well as the total profit without polymer
% injection.
%
% While polymer is injected, the net present value may be lower than
% without polymer as there is an increased cost. Once the polymer injection
% phase is over, however, we hope to reap the benefits and get an increased
% oil output resulting in a bigger total value for the reservoir lifetime.
