function veloc = computeVelocTPFA(G, intInx)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function veloc = computeVelocTPFA(G, intInx)
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%   Setup the operator which computes an approximation of the square
%   of the velocity for each cell given fluxes on the faces. 
%
%   We use a velocity reconstruction of the type  v_c  = 1/V * sum_{f} (x_f -x_c)u_f
%   where
%     v_c : Approximated alue of the velocity at the cell center
%     V   : Cell volume
%     f   : Face
%     x_f : Centroid of the face f
%     x_c : Centroid of the cell
%     u_f : flux at the face f
%    
%   Such reconstruction is exact for linear functions and first order accurate,
%   when a mimetic discretization is used or, in the case of TPFA, if the grid is
%   K-orthogonal. Note that it gives very large errors for cells that contain
%   well, as the pressure in such cells is only badly approximated by linear
%   functions.
%
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G      - Grid structure
%   intInx - Logical vector giving the internal faces.
%
% RETURNS:
%   sqVeloc - Function of the form u=sqVeloc(v), which returns cell-valued
%   square of the velocity for given face-valued fluxes v.
