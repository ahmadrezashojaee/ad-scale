function sqVeloc = computeSqVelocTPFA(G, intInx)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function sqVeloc = computeSqVelocTPFA(G, intInx)
%
% DESCRIPTION: Setup the operator which computes an approximation of the square
% of the velocity for each cell given fluxes on the faces. The following
% method is used
%
% 1) For each face, we compute a square velocity by taking the square of the
% flux after having divided it by the area. We obtain a scalar-valued variable
% per face
%
% 2) From a scalar variable, a vector can be reconstructed on each face, using
% the coordinate of the vector joining the cell centroid to the face
% centroid. Let c denotes this vector, after renormalization, (example:
% c=[1;0;0]' for a face of a Cartesian 3D grid) then, from a scalar value f on
% the face, we construct the vector-valued variable given by f*c.
%
% 3) We use the reconstruction defined in 2) to construct vector-valued
% square velocity from the scalar-valued square velocity defined in 1).
%
% 4) We take the average of the vector-valued obtained in 3) . We use a
% weight in the average so that faces that are far from the cell centroid
% contribute less than those that are close. See implementation for how this
% is done.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G      - Grid structure
%   intInx - Logical vector giving the internal faces.
%
% RETURNS:
%   sqVeloc - Function of the form u=sqVeloc(v), which returns cell-valued
%   square of the velocity for given face-valued fluxes v.
%
% EXAMPLE:
