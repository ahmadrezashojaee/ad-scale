README
What is this repository for?

MRST Fracture Module is a package for simulating multi-phase flow in fractured porous media using single- and multi-continuum concepts.
Version v2020

How do I get set up?

Software requirements:

	MATLAB
	MRST 2019a and higher (https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/download/)

Where to start?

	Execute startup.m in MRST base folder
	Execute startup_hw.m  from this repository to set up the path variables within MATLAB
	Examples folder contains several examples for discrete fracture and matrix modelling, multi-continua 		
    modelling but also combination of both.

Documentation: 

	March et al., A Unified Framework for Flow Simulation in Fractured Reservoirs, 2021 (Chapter in the upcoming MRST 		
    book 'Advanced Modelling with MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)', preprint available upon request)
