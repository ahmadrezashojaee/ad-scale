function state = initState(G, W, p0, varargin)
%Initialise state object for reservoir and wells.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   state = initState(G, W, p0)
%   state = initState(G, W, p0, s0)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - Grid structure.
%
%   W  - Well structure.  Pass an empty array for models without wells.
%
%   p0 - Initial reservoir pressure.  Also used as initial well BHP.
%
%   s0 - Initial reservoir composition (saturation).  If the model contains
%        wells, then the number of declared components in the injected well
%        fluids must equal the number of declared components in the
%        reservoir fluids.
%
% RETURNS:
%   state - Initial reservoir (and well) state object.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `grid_structure`, `addWell`.
