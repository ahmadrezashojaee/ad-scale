%% Introduction to Automatic Differentiation
% Automatic differentiation is, quoting from
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation Wikipedia>: "_a
% set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function
% specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer
% program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary
% arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
% etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying
% the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary
% order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and
% using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the
% original program._"
%
% In MRST, we have implemented automatic differentiation using operator
% overloading. In this tutorial, we give you a very brief introduction to
% our implementation of AD, which is specifically geared towards
% discretization of partial differential equations and computation with
% long vectors and sparse matrices. Unlike many other implementations of
% AD, we have chosen to keep individual Jacobians as a list of sparse
% matrices and not automatically expand into a large global matrix. This
% ensures efficiency and flexibility in manipulating matrix blocks
% corresponding to subequations of (complex) equation systems.

%% Simple formula using two scalars
% Compute z = 3 exp(-xy) and its partial derivatives wrt x and y. First, we
% compute it manually and then using automatic differentiation (AD). To
% understand what is going on behind the curtains when using AD, you can
% set a breakpoint at line 13 and use the 'Step into' function to step
% through the different functions that are invoked when evaluating z
